His name is <a href=\"cognate\">cognate</a> with the first element of his <a href=\"ancient%20Roman%20religion\">Roman</a> <a href=\"interpretatio%20graeca\">equivalent</a> <a href=\"Jupiter%20%28mythology%29\">Jupiter</a>. His mythologies and powers are similar, though not identical, to those of Indo-European deities such as <a href=\"Jupiter%20%28mythology%29\">Jupiter</a>, <a href=\"Perk%C5%ABnas\">Perkūnas</a>, <a href=\"Perun\">Perun</a>, <a href=\"Indra\">Indra</a> and <a href=\"Thor\">Thor</a>.\\n\\nZeus is the child of <a href=\"Cronus\">Cronus</a> and <a href=\"Rhea%20%28mythology%29\">Rhea</a>, the youngest of his siblings to be born, though sometimes reckoned the eldest as the others required disgorging from Cronus\\'s stomach. In most traditions, he is married to <a href=\"Hera\">Hera</a>, by whom he is usually said to have fathered <a href=\"Ares\">Ares</a>, <a href=\"Hebe%20%28mythology%29\">Hebe</a>, and <a href=\"Hephaestus\">Hephaestus</a>. At the <a href=\"oracle\">oracle</a> of <a href=\"Dodona\">Dodona</a>, his consort was said to be <a href=\"Dione%20%28Titaness/Oceanid%29\">Dione</a>, by whom the <i><a href=\"Iliad\">Iliad</a></i> states that he fathered <a href=\"Aphrodite\">Aphrodite</a>. Zeus was also infamous for his erotic escapades. These resulted in many divine and heroic offspring, including <a href=\"Athena\">Athena</a>, <a href=\"Apollo\">Apollo</a>, <a href=\"Artemis\">Artemis</a>, <a href=\"Hermes\">Hermes</a>, <a href=\"Persephone\">Persephone</a>, <a href=\"Dionysus\">Dionysus</a>, <a href=\"Perseus\">Perseus</a>, <a href=\"Heracles\">Heracles</a>, <a href=\"Helen%20of%20Troy\">Helen of Troy</a>, <a href=\"Minos\">Minos</a>, and the <a href=\"Muse\">Muses</a>.\\n\\nHe was respected as an <a href=\"Sky%20father\">allfather</a> who was chief of the gods and assigned roles to the others: \"Even the gods who are not his natural children address him as Father, and all the gods rise in his presence.\" He was <a href=\"interpretatio%20graeca\">equated</a> with many foreign <a href=\"weather%20god\">weather gods</a>, permitting <a href=\"Pausanias%20%28geographer%29\">Pausanias</a> to observe \"That Zeus is king in heaven is a saying common to all men\". Zeus\\' symbols are the <a href=\"thunderbolt\">thunderbolt</a>, <a href=\"eagle\">eagle</a>, <a href=\"bull%20%28mythology%29\">bull</a>, and <a href=\"oak\">oak</a>. In addition to his <a href=\"Dyeus\">Indo-European inheritance</a>, the classical \"cloud-gatherer\" (Greek: , <i>Nephelēgereta</i>) also derives certain iconographic traits from the cultures of the <a href=\"ancient%20Near%20East\">ancient Near East</a>, such as the <a href=\"scepter\">scepter</a>. Zeus is frequently depicted by Greek artists in one of two poses: standing, striding forward with a thunderbolt leveled in his raised right hand, or seated in majesty.\\n\\nName.The god\\'s name in the nominative is (<i>Zeús</i>).

Rhea gave birth to Zeus in Crete, handing Cronus a rock wrapped in swaddling clothes, which he promptly swallowed.\\n\\nInfancy.Varying versions of the story exist:\\n\\n<ul><li>1. According to Hyginus (Fabulae, 139)) Zeus was raised by a nymph named Amalthea. Since Saturn (Cronus) ruled over the <a href=\"Earth\">Earth</a>, the <a href=\"heaven\">heavens</a> and the <a href=\"sea\">sea</a>, she hid him by dangling him on a <a href=\"rope\">rope</a> from a <a href=\"tree\">tree</a> so he was suspended between earth, sea and sky and thus, invisible to his father.\\n</li><li>2. According to Pseudo-Apollodorus (Bibliotheca, <a href=\"http%3A//www.theoi.com/Text/Apollodorus1.html%231\">1.1.5-7</a>)) Zeus was raised by a <a href=\"goat\">goat</a> named <a href=\"Amalthea%20%28mythology%29\">Amalthea</a> in a cave called Dictaeon Antron (<a href=\"Psychro%20Cave\">Psychro Cave</a>). A a company of soldiers called <a href=\"Kouretes\">Kouretes</a> danced, shouted and clashed their spears against their shields so that Cronus would not hear the baby\\'s cry.\\n</li></ul>\\nKing of the gods.After reaching manhood, Zeus forced Cronus to disgorge first the stone (which was set down at <a href=\"Pytho\">Pytho</a> under the glens of <a href=\"Parnassus\">Parnassus</a> to be a sign to mortal men, the <a href=\"Omphalos\">Omphalos</a>) then his siblings in reverse order of swallowing. In some versions, <a href=\"Metis%20%28mythology%29\">Metis</a> gave Cronus an <a href=\"emetic\">emetic</a> to force him to disgorge the babies, or Zeus cut Cronus\\'s <a href=\"stomach\">stomach</a> open. Then Zeus released the brothers of Cronus, the <a href=\"Hekatonkheires\">Hecatonchires</a> and the <a href=\"Cyclopes\">Cyclopes</a>, from their dungeon in <a href=\"Tartarus\">Tartarus</a>, killing their guard, <a href=\"Campe\">Campe</a>.\\n\\nAs a token of their appreciation, the Cyclopes gave him <a href=\"thunder\">thunder</a> and the thunderbolt, or <a href=\"lightning\">lightning</a>, which had previously been hidden by Gaia. Together, Zeus, his brothers and sisters, Hecatonchires and Cyclopes overthrew Cronus and the other Titans, in the combat called the <a href=\"Titanomachy\">Titanomachy</a>. The defeated Titans were then cast into a shadowy underworld region known as Tartarus. <a href=\"Atlas%20%28mythology%29\">Atlas</a>, one of the titans who fought against Zeus, was punished by having to hold up the sky.\\n\\nAfter the battle with the Titans, Zeus shared the world with his elder brothers, <a href=\"Poseidon\">Poseidon</a> and <a href=\"Hades\">Hades</a>, by drawing lots: Zeus got the sky and air, Poseidon the waters, and Hades the world of the dead (the underworld). The ancient Earth, <a href=\"Gaia%20%28mythology%29\">Gaia</a>, could not be claimed; she was left to all three, each according to their capabilities, which explains why Poseidon was the \"earth-shaker\" (the god of earthquakes) and Hades claimed the humans who died (see also <a href=\"Penthus\">Penthus</a>).\\n\\nGaia resented the way Zeus had treated the Titans, because they were her children. Soon after taking the throne as king of the gods, Zeus had to fight some of Gaia\\'s other children, the <a href=\"monster\">monsters</a> <a href=\"Typhon\">Typhon</a> and <a href=\"Echidna%20%28mythology%29\">Echidna</a>. He vanquished Typhon and trapped him under <a href=\"Mount%20Etna\">Mount Etna</a>, but left Echidna and her children alive.\\n\\nConflicts with humans.When Zeus was atop Mount Olympus he was appalled by human sacrifice and other signs of human decadence.

After the flood, only <a href=\"Deucalion\">Deucalion</a> and <a href=\"Pyrrha\">Pyrrha</a> remained. This <a href=\"Flood%20myth\">flood narrative</a> is a common motif in mythology.\\n\\nThroughout history Zeus has been depicted as using violence to get his way and terrorize humans. As god of the sky he has the power to hurl lightning bolts as a weapon. Since lightning is quite powerful and sometimes deadly, it is a bold sign when lightning strikes because it is known that Zeus most likely threw the bolt.\\n\\nIn the <i>Iliad</i>.The <i><a href=\"Iliad\">Iliad</a></i> is a poem by <a href=\"Homer\">Homer</a> about the <a href=\"Trojan%20war\">Trojan war</a> and the battle over the City of <a href=\"Troy\">Troy</a>, in which Zeus plays a major part.\\n\\nScenes in which Zeus appears include:\\n\\n<ul><li>- Book 2: Zeus sends <a href=\"Agamemnon\">Agamemnon</a> a dream and is able to partially control his decisions because of the effects of the dream\\n</li><li>- Book 4: Zeus promises <a href=\"Hera\">Hera</a> to ultimately destroy the City of Troy at the end of the war\\n</li><li>- Book 7: Zeus and <a href=\"Poseidon\">Poseidon</a> ruin the <a href=\"Achaeans%20%28Homer%29\">Achaeans</a> fortress\\n</li><li>- Book 8: Zeus prohibits the other Gods from fighting each other and has to return to <a href=\"Mount%20Ida\">Mount Ida</a> where he can think over his decision that the Greeks will lose the war\\n</li><li>- Book 14: Zeus is seduced by <a href=\"Hera\">Hera</a> and becomes distracted while she helps out the Greeks\\n</li><li>- Book 15: Zeus wakes up and realizes that <a href=\"Poseidon\">Poseidon</a> his own brother has been helping out the Greeks, while also sending <a href=\"Hector\">Hector</a> and <a href=\"Apollo\">Apollo</a> to help fight the Trojans ensuring that the City of Troy will fall\\n</li><li>- Book 16: Zeus is upset that he couldn\\'t help save <a href=\"Sarpedon%20%28Trojan%20War%20hero%29\">Sarpedon</a>\\'s life because it would then contradict his previous decisions\\n</li><li>- Book 17: Zeus is emotionally hurt by the fate of <a href=\"Hector\">Hector</a>\\n</li><li>- Book 20: Zeus lets the other Gods help out their respective sides in the war\\n</li><li>- Book 24: Zeus demands that <a href=\"Achilles\">Achilles</a> release the corpse of <a href=\"Hector\">Hector</a> to be buried honourably\\n</li></ul>\\nList of other deeds.<ul><li>- Zeus granted <a href=\"Callirrhoe%20%28daughter%20of%20Achelous%29\">Callirrhoe\\'s</a> prayer that her sons by <a href=\"Alcmaeon%20%28mythology%29\">Alcmaeon</a>, <a href=\"Acarnan\">Acarnan</a> and <a href=\"Amphoterus%20%28son%20of%20Alcmaeon%29\">Amphoterus</a>, grow quickly so that they might be able to avenger the death of their father by the hands of <a href=\"Phegeus%20%28king%20of%20Psophis%29\">Phegeus</a> and his two sons.\\n</li><li>- He unsuccessfully wooed Thetis, daughter of Nereus.\\n</li></ul>\\nZeus and Hera.Zeus was brother and consort of <a href=\"Hera\">Hera</a>.

Their quadrennial <a href=\"festival\">festival</a> featured the famous Games. There was also an altar to Zeus made not of stone, but of ash, from the accumulated remains of many centuries\\' worth of animals sacrificed there.\\n\\nOutside of the major inter-<a href=\"polis\">polis</a> sanctuaries, there were no modes of worshipping Zeus precisely shared across the Greek world. Most of the titles listed below, for instance, could be found at any number of <a href=\"Greek%20temple\">Greek temples</a> from <a href=\"Asia%20Minor\">Asia Minor</a> to <a href=\"Sicily\">Sicily</a>. Certain modes of ritual were held in common as well: sacrificing a white animal over a raised altar, for instance.\\n\\nZeus Velchanos.With one exception, Greeks were unanimous in recognizing the birthplace of Zeus as Crete. Minoan culture contributed many essentials of ancient Greek religion: \"by a hundred channels the old civilization emptied itself into the new\", Will Durant observed, and Cretan Zeus retained his youthful Minoan features. The local child of the Great Mother, \"a small and inferior deity who took the roles of son and consort\", whose Minoan name the Greeks Hellenized as Velchanos, was in time assumed as an <a href=\"epithet\">epithet</a> by Zeus, as transpired at many other sites, and he came to be venerated in Crete as Zeus Velchanos (\"boy-Zeus\"), often simply the <i><a href=\"Kouros\">Kouros</a></i>.\\n\\nIn <a href=\"Crete\">Crete</a>, Zeus was worshipped at a number of caves at <a href=\"Knossos\">Knossos</a>, <a href=\"Mount%20Ida%2C%20Crete\">Ida</a> and <a href=\"Palaikastro\">Palaikastro</a>. In the Hellenistic period a small sanctuary dedicated to Zeus Velchanos was founded at the <a href=\"Hagia%20Triada\">Hagia Triada</a> site of a long-ruined Minoan palace. Broadly contemporary coins from <a href=\"Phaistos\">Phaistos</a> show the form under which he was worshiped: a youth sits among the branches of a tree, with a cockerel on his knees. On other Cretan coins Velchanos is represented as an eagle and in association with a goddess celebrating a mystic marriage. Inscriptions at <a href=\"Gortyn\">Gortyn</a> and Lyttos record a <i>Velchania</i> festival, showing that Velchanios was still widely venerated in Hellenistic Crete.\\n\\nThe stories of <a href=\"Minos\">Minos</a> and <a href=\"Epimenides\">Epimenides</a> suggest that these caves were once used for <a href=\"Incubation%20%28ritual%29\">incubatory</a> divination by kings and priests. The dramatic setting of <a href=\"Plato\">Plato</a>\\'s <i>Laws</i> is along the pilgrimage-route to one such site, emphasizing archaic Cretan knowledge. On Crete, Zeus was represented in art as a long-haired youth rather than a mature adult and hymned as <i>ho megas kouros</i>, \"the great youth\". Ivory statuettes of the \"Divine Boy\" were unearthed near the <a href=\"Labyrinth\">Labyrinth</a> at <a href=\"Knossos\">Knossos</a> by <a href=\"Sir%20Arthur%20Evans\">Sir Arthur Evans</a>. With the <a href=\"Kouretes\">Kouretes</a>, a band of ecstatic armed dancers, he presided over the rigorous military-athletic training and secret rites of the Cretan <i><a href=\"paideia\">paideia</a></i>.\\n\\nThe myth of the death of Cretan Zeus, localised in numerous mountain sites though only mentioned in a comparatively late source, <a href=\"Callimachus\">Callimachus</a>, together with the assertion of <a href=\"Antoninus%20Liberalis\">Antoninus Liberalis</a> that a fire shone forth annually from the birth-cave the infant shared with a <a href=\"Bees%20%28mythology%29\">mythic swarm of bees</a>, suggests that Velchanos had been an annual vegetative spirit.\\nThe Hellenistic writer <a href=\"Euhemerus\">Euhemerus</a> apparently proposed a theory that Zeus had actually been a great king of <a href=\"Crete\">Crete</a> and that posthumously, his glory had slowly turned him into a deity. The works of Euhemerus himself have not survived, but Christian patristic writers took up the suggestion.\\n\\nZeus Lykaios.The epithet Zeus Lykaios (\"wolf-Zeus\") is assumed by Zeus only in connection with the archaic festival of the <a href=\"Lykaia\">Lykaia</a> on the slopes of <a href=\"Lycaeus\">Mount Lykaion</a> (\"Wolf Mountain\"), the tallest peak in rustic <a href=\"Arcadia\">Arcadia</a>; Zeus had only a formal connection with the rituals and myths of this primitive <a href=\"rite%20of%20passage\">rite of passage</a> with an ancient threat of <a href=\"cannibalism\">cannibalism</a> and the possibility of a <a href=\"werewolf\">werewolf</a> transformation for the <a href=\"ephebos\">ephebes</a> who were the participants. Near the ancient ash-heap where the sacrifices took place was a forbidden precinct in which, allegedly, no shadows were ever cast.\\n\\nAccording to <a href=\"Plato\">Plato</a>, a particular clan would gather on the mountain to make a sacrifice every nine years to Zeus Lykaios, and a single morsel of human entrails would be intermingled with the animal\\'s. Whoever ate the human flesh was said to turn into a wolf, and could only regain human form if he did not eat again of human flesh until the next nine-year cycle had ended. There were games associated with the Lykaia, removed in the fourth century to the first urbanization of Arcadia, <a href=\"Megalopolis%2C%20Greece\">Megalopolis</a>; there the major temple was dedicated to Zeus Lykaios.\\n\\nThere is, however, the crucial detail that <i>Lykaios</i> or <i>Lykeios</i> (epithets of Zeus and Apollo) may derive from <a href=\"Proto-Greek%20language\">Proto-Greek</a> *, \"light\", a noun still attested in compounds such as , \"twilight\", , \"year\" (lit. \"light\\'s course\") etc. This, Cook argues, brings indeed much new \\'light\\' to the matter as <a href=\"Achaeus%20of%20Eretria\">Achaeus</a>, the contemporary tragedian of <a href=\"Sophocles\">Sophocles</a>, spoke of Zeus Lykaios as \"starry-eyed\", and this Zeus Lykaios may just be the Arcadian Zeus, son of Aether, described by <a href=\"Cicero\">Cicero</a>. Again under this new signification may be seen <a href=\"Pausanias%20%28geographer%29\">Pausanias</a>\\' descriptions of Lykosoura being \\'the first city that ever the sun beheld\\', and of the altar of Zeus, at the summit of Mount Lykaion, before which stood two columns bearing gilded eagles and \\'facing the sun-rise\\'. Further Cook sees only the tale of Zeus\\' sacred precinct at Mount Lykaion allowing no shadows referring to Zeus as \\'god of light\\' (Lykaios).\\n\\nAdditional cults of Zeus.Although etymology indicates that Zeus was originally a sky god, many Greek cities honored a local Zeus who lived underground. Athenians and Sicilians honored Zeus Meilichios (\"kindly\" or \"honeyed\") while other cities had Zeus Chthonios (\"earthy\"), Zeus Katachthonios (\"under-the-earth\") and Zeus Plousios (\"wealth-bringing\"). These deities might be represented as snakes or in human form in visual art, or, for emphasis as both together in one image. They also received offerings of black animal victims sacrificed into sunken pits, as did <a href=\"chthonic\">chthonic</a> deities like <a href=\"Persephone\">Persephone</a> and <a href=\"Demeter\">Demeter</a>, and also the <a href=\"hero\">heroes</a> at their tombs. Olympian gods, by contrast, usually received white victims sacrificed upon raised altars.\\n\\nIn some cases, cities were not entirely sure whether the <i>daimon</i> to whom they sacrificed was a hero or an underground Zeus. Thus the shrine at Lebadaea in <a href=\"Boeotia\">Boeotia</a> might belong to the hero <a href=\"Trophonius\">Trophonius</a> or to Zeus Trephonius (\"the nurturing\"), depending on whether you believe <a href=\"Pausanias%20%28geographer%29\">Pausanias</a>, or <a href=\"Strabo\">Strabo</a>. The hero <a href=\"Amphiaraus\">Amphiaraus</a> was honored as Zeus Amphiaraus at Oropus outside of <a href=\"Thebes%2C%20Greece\">Thebes</a>, and the Spartans even had a shrine to Zeus Agamemnon. Ancient <a href=\"Molossians\">Molossian</a> kings sacrificed to <a href=\"Zeus%20Areius\">Zeus Areius</a>. <a href=\"Strabo\">Strabo</a> mention that at <a href=\"Tralles\">Tralles</a> there was the Zeus Larisaeus.\\n\\nNon-panhellenic cults.In addition to the Panhellenic titles and conceptions listed above, local cults maintained their own idiosyncratic ideas about the king of gods and men. With the epithet Zeus <a href=\"Aetnaeus\">Aetnaeus</a> he was worshiped on <a href=\"Mount%20Etna\">Mount Aetna</a>, where there was a statue of him, and a local festival called the Aetnaea in his honor. Other examples are listed below. As Zeus Aeneius or Zeus Aenesius, he was worshiped in the island of <a href=\"Cephalonia\">Cephalonia</a>, where he had a temple on <a href=\"Mount%20Ainos\">Mount Aenos</a>.\\n\\nOracles of Zeus.Although most oracle sites were usually dedicated to <a href=\"Apollo\">Apollo</a>, the heroes, or various goddesses like <a href=\"Themis\">Themis</a>, a few oracular sites were dedicated to Zeus. In addition, some foreign oracles, such as <a href=\"Ba%CA%BFal\">Baʿal</a>\\'s at <a href=\"Heliopolis%20%28Syria%29\">Heliopolis</a>, were <a href=\"interpretatio%20graeca\">associated</a> with Zeus in Greek or <a href=\"Jupiter\">Jupiter</a> in Latin.\\n\\nThe Oracle at Dodona.The cult of Zeus at <a href=\"Dodona\">Dodona</a> in <a href=\"Epirus\">Epirus</a>, where there is evidence of religious activity from the second millennium BC onward, centered on a sacred oak. When the <i><a href=\"Odyssey\">Odyssey</a></i> was composed (circa 750 BC), divination was done there by barefoot priests called <i>Selloi</i>, who lay on the ground and observed the rustling of the leaves and branches. By the time <a href=\"Herodotus\">Herodotus</a> wrote about Dodona, female priestesses called <a href=\"peleiades\">peleiades</a> (\"doves\") had replaced the male priests.\\n\\nZeus\\' consort at Dodona was not <a href=\"Hera\">Hera</a>, but the goddess <a href=\"Dione%20%28Titaness/Oceanid%29\">Dione</a> — whose name is a feminine form of \"Zeus\". Her status as a <a href=\"Titan%20%28mythology%29\">titaness</a> suggests to some that she may have been a more powerful pre-Hellenic deity, and perhaps the original occupant of the oracle.\\n\\nThe Oracle at Siwa.The <a href=\"oracle%20of%20Ammon\">oracle of Ammon</a> at the <a href=\"Siwa%20Oasis\">Siwa Oasis</a> in the Western Desert of <a href=\"Egypt\">Egypt</a> did not lie within the bounds of the Greek world before <a href=\"Alexander%20the%20Great\">Alexander</a>\\'s day, but it already loomed large in the Greek mind during the archaic era: <a href=\"Herodotus\">Herodotus</a> mentions consultations with Zeus Ammon in his account of the <a href=\"Greco-Persian%20Wars\">Persian War</a>. Zeus Ammon was especially favored at <a href=\"Sparta\">Sparta</a>, where a temple to him existed by the time of the <a href=\"Peloponnesian%20War\">Peloponnesian War</a>.\\n\\nAfter Alexander made a trek into the desert to consult the oracle at Siwa, the figure arose in the Hellenistic imagination of a <a href=\"Libyan%20Sibyl\">Libyan Sibyl</a>.\\n\\nZeus and foreign gods.Zeus was identified with the <a href=\"Roman%20mythology\">Roman</a> god <a href=\"Jupiter%20%28mythology%29\">Jupiter</a> and associated in the syncretic classical imagination (see <i><a href=\"interpretatio%20graeca\">interpretatio graeca</a></i>) with various other deities, such as the <a href=\"Egyptian%20mythology\">Egyptian</a> <a href=\"Amun\">Ammon</a> and the <a href=\"Etruscan%20mythology\">Etruscan</a> <a href=\"Tinia\">Tinia</a>. He, along with <a href=\"Dionysus\">Dionysus</a>, absorbed the role of the chief <a href=\"Phrygia\">Phrygian</a> god <a href=\"Sabazios\">Sabazios</a> in the <a href=\"Syncretism\">syncretic</a> deity known in Rome as <a href=\"Sabazius\">Sabazius</a>. The Seleucid ruler <a href=\"Antiochus%20IV%20Epiphanes\">Antiochus IV Epiphanes</a> erected a statue of Zeus Olympios in the Judean Temple in Jerusalem. Hellenizing Jews referred to this statue as <a href=\"Baal\">Baal</a> Shamen (in English, Lord of Heaven).\\n\\nZeus and the sun.Zeus is occasionally conflated with the Hellenic <a href=\"sun%20god\">sun god</a>, <a href=\"Helios\">Helios</a>, who is sometimes either directly referred to as Zeus\\' eye, or clearly implied as such. <a href=\"Hesiod\">Hesiod</a>, for instance, describes Zeus\\' eye as effectively the sun. This perception is possibly derived from earlier <a href=\"Proto-Indo-European%20religion\">Proto-Indo-European religion</a>, in which the sun is occasionally envisioned as the eye of <a href=\"Dyeus\">*<i>Dyḗus Pḥtḗr</i></a> (see <a href=\"Hvare-khshaeta\">Hvare-khshaeta</a>).\\n\\nThe <a href=\"Crete\">Cretan</a> Zeus <a href=\"Talos\">Tallaios</a> had solar elements to his cult. \"Talos\" was the local equivalent of Helios.\\n\\nZeus in philosophy.In <a href=\"Neoplatonism\">Neoplatonism</a>, Zeus\\' relation to the gods familiar from mythology is taught as the <a href=\"Demiurge\">Demiurge</a> or Divine <a href=\"nous\">Mind</a>. Specifically within <a href=\"Plotinus\">Plotinus</a>\\'s work the <i><a href=\"Enneads\">Enneads</a></i> and the <i>Platonic Theology</i> of <a href=\"Proclus\">Proclus</a>.\\n\\nZeus in the Bible.Zeus is mentioned in the New Testament twice, first in Acts 14:8–13: When the people living in <a href=\"Lystra\">Lystra</a> saw the <a href=\"Apostle%20Paul\">Apostle Paul</a> heal a lame man, they considered Paul and his partner <a href=\"Barnabas\">Barnabas</a> to be gods, identifying Paul with <a href=\"Hermes\">Hermes</a> and Barnabas with Zeus, even trying to offer them sacrifices with the crowd. Two ancient inscriptions discovered in 1909 near Lystra testify to the worship of these two gods in that city. One of the inscriptions refers to the \"priests of Zeus\", and the other mentions \"Hermes Most Great\"\" and \"Zeus the sun-god\".\\n\\nThe second occurrence is in Acts 28:11: the name of the ship in which the prisoner Paul set sail from the island of Malta bore the <a href=\"figurehead\">figurehead</a> \"Sons of Zeus\" aka <a href=\"Castor%20and%20Pollux\">Castor and Pollux</a>.\\n\\nThe deuterocanonical book of <a href=\"2%20Maccabees\">2 Maccabees</a> 6:1, 2 talks of King <a href=\"Antiochus%20IV\">Antiochus IV</a> (Epiphanes), who in his attempt to stamp out the Jewish religion, directed that the temple at Jerusalem be profaned and rededicated to Zeus (Jupiter Olympius).\\n\\nIn modern culture.Depictions of Zeus as a bull, the form he took when abducting <a href=\"Europa%20%28mythology%29\">Europa</a>, are found on the Greek 2-<a href=\"euro%20%28currency%29\">euro</a> coin and on the <a href=\"United%20Kingdom\">United Kingdom</a> identity card for visa holders. <a href=\"Mary%20Beard%20%28classicist%29\">Mary Beard</a>, professor of Classics at <a href=\"Cambridge%20University\">Cambridge University</a>, has criticised this for its apparent celebration of rape.\\n\\nZeus has been portrayed by Axel Ringvall in <i>Jupiter på jorden</i>, the first known film adaption to feature Zeus; <a href=\"Niall%20MacGinnis\">Niall MacGinnis</a> in <i><a href=\"Jason%20and%20the%20Argonauts%20%281963%20film%29\">Jason and the Argonauts</a></i> and <a href=\"Angus%20MacFadyen\">Angus MacFadyen</a> in the <a href=\"Jason%20and%20the%20Argonauts%20%28TV%20miniseries%29\">2000 remake</a>; <a href=\"Laurence%20Olivier\">Laurence Olivier</a> in the original <i><a href=\"Clash%20of%20the%20Titans%20%281981%20film%29\">Clash of the Titans</a></i>, and <a href=\"Liam%20Neeson\">Liam Neeson</a> in the <a href=\"Clash%20of%20the%20Titans%20%282010%20film%29\">2010 remake</a>, along with the 2012 sequel <a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Titans\">Wrath of the Titans</a>; <a href=\"Anthony%20Quinn\">Anthony Quinn</a> in the 1990s TV series <i></i>; <a href=\"Rip%20Torn\">Rip Torn</a> in the Disney animated feature <i><a href=\"Hercules%20%281997%20film%29\">Hercules</a></i>; <a href=\"Corey%20Burton\">Corey Burton</a> in <i><a href=\"Hercules%20%281998%20TV%20series%29\">Hercules</a></i>, <i><a href=\"God%20of%20War%20II\">God of War II</a></i>, <i><a href=\"God%20of%20War%20III\">God of War III</a></i>, <i></i>, <i><a href=\"PlayStation%20All-Stars%20Battle%20Royale\">PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale</a></i>, and <i><a href=\"Kingdom%20Hearts%203\">Kingdom Hearts 3</a></i>; and <a href=\"Sean%20Bean\">Sean Bean</a> in <i></i> (2010).\\n\\nSee also.<ul><li>- <a href=\"Achaean%20League\">Achaean League</a>\\n</li><li>- <a href=\"Agetor\">Agetor</a>\\n</li><li>- <a href=\"Ambulia\">Ambulia</a> - Spartan epithet used for <a href=\"Athena\">Athena</a>, Zeus, and <a href=\"Castor%20and%20Pollux\">Castor and Pollux</a>\\n</li><li>- <a href=\"Deception%20of%20Zeus\">Deception of Zeus</a>\\n</li><li>- <a href=\"Hetairideia\">Hetairideia</a> – Thessalian Festival to Zeus\\n</li><li>- <a href=\"Temple%20of%20Zeus%2C%20Olympia\">Temple of Zeus, Olympia</a>\\n</li><li>- <a href=\"Zanes%20of%20Olympia\">Zanes of Olympia</a> - Statues of Zeus\\n</li></ul>\\nReferences.<ul><li>- Burkert, Walter, (1977) 1985. <i>Greek Religion</i>, especially section III.ii.1 (Harvard University Press)\\n</li><li>- <a href=\"Arthur%20Bernard%20Cook\">Cook, Arthur Bernard</a>, <i>Zeus: A Study in Ancient Religion</i>, (3 volume set), (1914–1925).
