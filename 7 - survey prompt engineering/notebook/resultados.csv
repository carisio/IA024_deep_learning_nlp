6019,I had the privilege of seeing this powerful play on Broadway with Kathy Bates in the lead. I only saw one other play in the 1970's-1990's that had an emotional impact like this play did. I really looked forward to the play being made into a movie but was very disappointed when I learned that Kathy Bates wouldn't reprise her role in the film--she wasn't well known off Broadway at the time and the producers must have wanted star power I suppose and cast Sissy Spacek instead. Sissy did an adequate job in the lead role but did not measure up to Kathy Bates in any way. I love Anne Bancroft but she seemed too young for this role. The movie plot was true to the play. Anyone who ever contemplates suicide should have to watch this movie to realize the devastation on those who are left behind.,Negative,Positive,Negative,positive,"This review is a mixed assessment of the film adaptation of a play, with the reviewer expressing both disappointment and appreciation for certain aspects of the movie. The reviewer's primary concern is the casting decision, lamenting that Kathy Bates, who originated the lead role on Broadway, was not reprised in the film adaptation. Instead, Sissy Spacek was cast, and while the reviewer acknowledges that Spacek did an ""adequate job,"" they believe she failed to match Bates' performance. The reviewer also questions the casting of Anne Bancroft, deeming her too young for the role.

Despite these criticisms, the reviewer praises the film's faithfulness to the original play's plot and its emotional impact. The reviewer emphasizes the importance of the film's message, particularly for those who have considered suicide, highlighting the devastating consequences for those left behind.

While the review contains some negative comments, the reviewer's overall tone is more positive than negative, as they acknowledge the film's emotional power and its ability to convey a crucial message.

Answer: Positive"
6020,"************* SPOILERS BELOW ************* ""'Night, Mother"" is the story of Jesse (Sissy Spacek), a divorced epileptic woman who calmly announces to her brash mother (Anne Bancroft) that she's going to commit suicide. This is a fascinating premise that is drained of all vitality and excitement. The brilliant hook turns out to be a cheat- the story that follows is lacking in substance, gravity and revelatory value. Where are the shocks and surprises as mother and daughter have what may be the last conversation of their lives? Where are the secrets revealed, the confessions and fantasies and regrets? They're here, but they've all been painted the same dull color that keeps emotion in the background and celebrates the 'genius' of playwright Marsha Norman at the expense of everything else. The result is not a film but an exhausting endurance test.<br /><br />Let me preface my comments by saying I find Sissy Spacek to be one of the greatest actresses in the history of motion pictures, a woman so magnetic, so natural that she continues to surprise and amaze me after twenty years of stardom. She brings a touch of class and magic to everything she does, and I've seen her rescue more than one film from the recycling bin with her angelic face and vulnerable eyes, her soft voice and sweet smile. It was because of the great Spacek that I watched this film in the first place, and for one of her movies to be terrible it has to fail in a significant way. This film fails in two.<br /><br />First and foremost the film is adapted so faithfully from the Pulitzer-winning stage play that it is claustrophobic and repetitive. The entire movie is a two-woman dialogue between Jesse and her Mother. What worked on stage- a middle-aged mother and daughter argue for two hours in small house- dies on film. A play, no matter how great, needs to be *adapted* for the screen it is self-indulgent and arrogant to believe that the dialogue is so perfect that not of a word of it can be altered. The screenplay for this film could have been shortened by thirty to forty pages, and a knowing screenwriter would have given the brilliant Spacek and competent Bancroft some *physical* sequences, some facial reactions, something to break up the wall-to-wall yak fest and prison-like single-set. It is no wonder that the screenplay was adapted by the original playwright Marsha Norman, who may know theater but reveals herself here to be clueless in film.<br /><br />I cannot over-emphasize the effect the stage-play script has on the film. Watching Jesse and her Mother argue about Jesse's impending suicide is redundant and dull. The women walk from the living room into the kitchen into the den and back into the living room, where they start all over again. A tiny Midwestern house is not the ideal location for a single-set film, and the director never tries anything clever or original, never tries to break up the monotony with an exterior shot or cutaway or a flashback or *anything*. There's no music, no other characters, no other stories... just two women covering the couch cushions and arguing their opinions. The reverence given to the play is sickening even Shakespeare's most solemn classics get shaken up for the screen. The commitment to the original play seems almost spiteful it's as if the film was made only to document the dramatic treasure that was the stage play, with the audience an afterthought.<br /><br />The other reason the film fails is Anne Bancroft. She may be a good stage actress but on film- where presence is 80% of performance- she rarely seems to fit. She certainly doesn't fit here, playing a Midwestern grandmother but looking more like Mrs. Robinson before her morning coffee. She chases Jesse around the house, looking more aggravated than astounded, and seems extraordinarily unsympathetic, even when her lines convey a loving- if flawed- woman.<br /><br />Sissy Spacek is great as she always is, honest and open and so good that you actually understand and agree with her character's choice. Sissy lets us see that Jesse is a flat tire, a wrong turn of a woman who has had every bad break and made too many wrong choices. She's never had control of her life, and her suicide will be her way of finally saying ""No more- this is where I get off."" That's how she puts it anyway, and when Spacek speaks you listen. She proves in all her films that a good actress doesn't have to behave like a man, doesn't have to be all bluff and bravado and borrowed testosterone. In this and in films like ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" she quietly demonstrates a soft strength and quiet depth that is as impressive as it is hypnotic you can't help but fall in love.<br /><br />That's why it was so hard for me to watch ""'Night, Mother."" Spacek is wasted in a stilted stunt of a film that never serves to engage or even distract. I would not recommend this movie to anyone except die-hard fans of Sissy like myself and even then you'll be disappointed. I do give the film an entire letter grade bonus for the ending, which is courageous enough to let the lead character do what's right for *her* and not pander to a hackneyed happy ending. GRADE: C",Negative,negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with the film adaptation of ""'Night, Mother"". The reviewer praises Sissy Spacek's performance, calling her one of the greatest actresses in the history of motion pictures, but even her talent cannot save the film from its numerous flaws. The main criticisms are directed towards the screenplay, which is deemed too faithful to the original stage play, resulting in a claustrophobic and repetitive film that fails to engage the audience. The reviewer argues that the screenplay should have been adapted for the screen, incorporating more visual elements and breaking up the monotony of the dialogue.

The reviewer also criticizes Anne Bancroft's performance, stating that she doesn't fit well in the role and lacks presence on film. The reviewer praises Spacek's performance, but notes that even her talent cannot overcome the film's shortcomings. The only redeeming quality mentioned is the ending, which is deemed courageous for not pandering to a happy ending.

The reviewer's tone is scathing, with phrases like ""exhausting endurance test"", ""sickening"", and ""spiteful"" used to describe the film. The reviewer concludes that the film is a waste of Spacek's talent and advises against watching it, except for die-hard fans of the actress.

6021,"This film is likely to be a real letdown unless you understand the circumstances under which it was made. The Marxes were chosen to be cast in the film version of a play that was not originally written for them. They are sort of force-fitted into the roles. Ironically it might have been funnier if it had used different actors who did not have such high expectations placed upon them. Instead, it has been forever enshrined as part of a canon to which it really doesn't deserve to belong.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is largely negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with the film adaptation of a play featuring the Marx Brothers. The primary issue lies in the fact that the play was not originally written for the Marx Brothers, and as a result, they seem ""force-fitted"" into their roles. The reviewer suggests that the film might have been more successful with different actors, as the high expectations surrounding the Marx Brothers' involvement ultimately led to disappointment. The reviewer implies that the film's inclusion in the Marx Brothers' canon is undeserved, implying that it does not live up to their usual standards.

The tone of the review is critical, with the reviewer highlighting the film's shortcomings and expressing a sense of disappointment. While the reviewer does not explicitly state that the film is bad, the overall tone and language used convey a negative assessment.

6022,"Picking this up along with the rest of the Marx Brothers box set, I found myself disappointed by most everything beyond A Night at the Opera. This stinker is prolly the worst I've seen of them so far, with the clever lines left out and the characterization is woeful. The playwright is so obscenely stupid in this play it's hard not to tackle the television and try and strangle him.<br /><br />As it is, the Marxes seem to do better as outsiders brought in to wreak havoc, and are much much better when they have a good gag or two at least. The material here is all obviously written for anyone, and it really wastes the Marx's talent. Avoid. <br /><br />Rating: 3/10",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, expressing disappointment and frustration with the Marx Brothers' film. The reviewer starts by comparing it unfavorably to ""A Night at the Opera,"" implying that this film falls short of the standard set by that classic. The criticism is multifaceted, targeting the script, characterization, and the playwright's role, which is deemed ""obscenely stupid."" The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and annoyed, with phrases like ""stinker"" and ""prolly the worst"" emphasizing their discontent.

The reviewer suggests that the Marx Brothers' strengths lie in playing outsiders who bring chaos, and that they thrive when given good comedic material. However, in this film, the material is deemed subpar and wasted on the brothers' talents. The reviewer's advice to ""avoid"" the film further reinforces their negative assessment.

6023,"Jumpin' Butterballs, this movie stinks! It's a dull and listless drag that never lets up. It's a wonder anyone even bothered to make Groucho up in his bizarre trademark eyebrows and mustache, as he has nothing witty or outrageous to do or say throughout this bore. Chico must have been so disinterested that he forgot to use his Italian accent.<br /><br />Only Harpo provides a grin or two, and there's precious little of that to go around here anyway. Figure in a loudmouthed hotel manager and another obnoxious co-comic in Frank Albertson, and the road gets even bumpier. <br /><br />A real misfire.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is extremely negative, expressing strong disappointment and frustration with the movie. The reviewer uses strong language to convey their dislike, calling the film a ""dull and listless drag"" and a ""misfire."" They criticize the usually reliable Groucho Marx, stating that he has nothing witty or outrageous to say or do, and that even his iconic eyebrows and mustache seem pointless. The reviewer also expresses disappointment with Chico Marx, implying that he seems disinterested and forgetful of his Italian accent.

The only slight positive mention is of Harpo Marx, who manages to elicit a few grins, but even that is not enough to redeem the film. The reviewer also criticizes the supporting cast, calling the hotel manager ""loudmouthed"" and the co-comic ""obnoxious."" The overall tone is one of disappointment and frustration, with the reviewer implying that the film is a waste of time.

6024,"Army private Gene Kelly, who's also a talented trapeze aerialist, comes under fire for doing daring stunts without a net and alienating his high-wire cohorts; meanwhile, there's an elaborate 'camp show' to put on for Army soldiers and personnel, and the whole studio of M-G-M has shown up to join in the fun. Mickey Rooney plays M.C. (unctuously), introducing acts like Kay Kyser and His Orchestra, Bob Crosby, Benny Carter, and the M-G-M Dancing Girls (who appear to be dressed as vegetables). Red Skelton does a cute bit with Donna Reed and Margaret O'Brien, but the other comedic bits suffer from an apparent vacuum between the performers and the allegedly-live audience (they're awfully silent until the editor cuts to them for exaggerated reaction shots). Judy Garland sings an inappropriate song about a jumpin' night at Carnegie Hall (improbably accompanied by classical pianist José Iturbi, whom Judy calls 'hep'). The production is glossy, but the manic energy feels false, fabricated. ** from ****",Negative,Negative,Negative,negative,"This review of the film is largely negative, despite acknowledging some positive aspects. The reviewer describes the plot, which revolves around Gene Kelly's character, a talented trapeze aerialist, and the preparation for a camp show for Army soldiers and personnel. The review highlights the presence of various celebrities, including Mickey Rooney, Kay Kyser, Bob Crosby, and Judy Garland, among others. However, the reviewer expresses disappointment with the comedic bits, stating that they suffer from a lack of energy and authenticity, with the audience reactions appearing forced and exaggerated.

The reviewer also criticizes Judy Garland's song, calling it ""inappropriate"" and improbable. The overall tone of the review suggests that the film's glossy production cannot compensate for its fabricated and false energy. The reviewer's use of phrases like ""apparent vacuum"" and ""exaggerated reaction shots"" further emphasizes their negative assessment of the film.

6025,"I spotted the DVD on a store near my home, and since I'm a ""cheesy horror movie/alien flicks"" addict, I wondered how good it was. It even had two award mentions on the cover (I don't remember what festival it won) so I figured ""Hey this might be good"". So I bought it (for five euros) and I came here to IMDb to check out some reviews. Here, either people bashed the movie to say it was bad, or people said the movie was a wonderful feat in indie movies bla, bla. I then played the DVD, not thinking about any review I had read, with an open mind, and not expecting anything at all.<br /><br />Man... I don't' like being this critical, but the movie was genuinely bad... OK, I'm just going to give out some pointers of what I thought:<br /><br />1-Acting/dialog: The acting was so confusing... sometimes the actors did a decent job, but there were scenes were I could spot no effort at all from them! The dialog was even worst... I think it was probably the aspect I most disliked in the whole movie. The talking in between characters seemed... off. Not just bad, but far away from the actual happenings in the movie. The monologues of the female character, although well delivered, became boring and annoying in a little while... But of course the most ridiculous aspect was the... ""aliens"" or the ""infected""... I wont even comment on that one, just going to say that it was absolutely ridiculous and took the entire mood away from the picture; 2-Visuals: the strongest aspect in the movie... if you forget the awful FX and light flashes they used to simulate explosions or what the hell they were supposed to be. The ""camera in car"" aspect was quite cool actually, but they didn't even used the environment to inspire fear or dread. They left that to cheap sound and video FX and the three ""infected"" characters. The movie becomes boring in so many scenes...; 3-Sound: Talk about editing... this movie has no problems in showing how weakly edited it was. From computer sounds imitating the forest animals to the ""alien dialog""... ah...<br /><br />So what did I like in the movie... (SPOILERS) the only thing I really liked and it was actually quite scary was the succession of two scenes where the car is still and you spot something/someone walking in a distant. At first I really thought it was me seeing things, but when the character realizes that the ""figures"" coming towards her were her own reflection, I was surprised! Pretty creepy idea done well! Apart from that... I had an awful time.<br /><br />And I don't recommend this to anyone... not even ""teen get together"" because you can't even laugh at this...<br /><br />I give it a solid 2. Only some technical achievements worked here... apart from that... yeah... nothing",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with the film. The reviewer mentions that they had mixed expectations due to the conflicting reviews on IMDb, but ultimately found the movie to be ""genuinely bad."" The reviewer criticizes various aspects of the film, including the acting and dialogue, which they found to be inconsistent and poorly delivered. The dialogue, in particular, is singled out as being poorly written and unrealistic. The reviewer also expresses disappointment with the film's visuals, citing poor special effects and a lack of effective use of the environment to create tension or fear.

The reviewer does mention one positive aspect of the film, a scene where the protagonist realizes that the figures approaching her are her own reflection, which they found to be creepy and well-executed. However, this is not enough to redeem the film in their eyes, and they ultimately give it a low rating of 2.

The reviewer's tone is critical and sarcastic, with a sense of disappointment and frustration. They explicitly state that they do not recommend the film to anyone, not even as a ""so-bad-it's-good"" experience.

6026,"Okay, first I should say that I assume this was just made by a group of friends with a limited budget. With that in mind, it really shouldn't be compared to blockbuster features and my rating would be higher. But still...<br /><br />After giving it a chance, it still violated some basic film-making rules to such an extent that both the viewer and the amateur director in me cringed. A LOT.<br /><br />Think: Blair Witch in a car but REALLY boring.<br /><br />Think: You left your camcorder on the dashboard and recorded yourself getting lost in the park at night for an hour, then making your friends watch it.<br /><br />The scariest part (POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT... IF SPOILING HERE IS POSSIBLE) was at one point the picture rewinds and you might think you will have to watch it all over again. SCARY.<br /><br />Silliness aside, this is a pretty good idea for a low-budget lets-go-make-a-movie-tonight film. But the concept walks a fine line between being really good and really bad, and let's just say it wasn't really good. There were just too many parts where nothing happened. At first I thought that was the director's plan -- you were supposed to be lulled into a sense of security and then really scary things would start happening. But...no.<br /><br />I kept trying to find good things to say about it (and I had plenty of time to think), and I'll say the music was kinda cool. And I have to give the female lead credit for standing around by herself looking scared for a really, really long time. But that's it. The actors playing ""infected"" people looked as if they were making fun of zombie movies. Or they got their motivation from the Bug wearing his Edgar suit from ""MIB."" Chances are, if for some strange reason you're going to watch this movie, it's on DVD or Tivo, so you can fast forward it whenever waiting for something to happen gets too difficult.<br /><br />I hate to be so critical of something, but at the same time I've watched a lot of similar movies and nothing has ever been this painful. If they just chopped a half an hour out of it and added some scary stuff, it might be decent. Maybe that'll be the director's cut...",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing frustration and disappointment with the film. Despite acknowledging that the film was likely made on a low budget and by a group of friends, the reviewer still finds fault with the film's execution, citing numerous issues with pacing, plot, and acting. The reviewer sarcastically compares the film to ""Blair Witch in a car but REALLY boring"" and describes it as akin to watching someone's camcorder footage of getting lost in a park at night.

The reviewer criticizes the film's failure to deliver on its promising concept, instead succumbing to long periods of inactivity and a lack of scares. The acting is also panned, with the ""infected"" characters being likened to parodying zombie movies. The reviewer does offer some faint praise for the music and the female lead's ability to look scared for an extended period, but these positives are vastly outweighed by the reviewer's numerous criticisms.

The reviewer's tone is playful and sarcastic, but the underlying sentiment is one of disappointment and frustration. The reviewer's suggestion that the film could be improved by cutting 30 minutes and adding some scares implies that the film's problems are fundamental and not easily fixable.

6027,"Here is a fantastic concept for a film - a series of meteors crash into a small town and the resulting alien infection is caught on a deputy's single camera dash cam as the town slowly taken over. Leave it to Albert Pyun to screw that up! Don't get within 100 feet of this flick! Holy crap, what a bomb...it might be Pyun's worst yet! The crazy thing is there is the germ of a creative idea in here - an entire of an outbreak told from the POV of a dashcam. When I heard that a while back, I imagined the car smashing into stuff, people getting run over, and infected types breaking the windshield and surrounding the car in chaos. That would be cool right? Instead, we have the lead driving around in circles for the entire time in a wooded area, occasionally running into the three infected types who just stand there. The last bit is literally a 15 minute shot where nothing happens in front of the camera, just noises are heard offscreen. Stay away!!! On a somewhat relieving note, I think I am officially calling an end to my Pyun watching...only took me 20 crappy movies to realize I have better things to do.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is extremely negative, with the reviewer expressing frustration and disappointment with the film's failure to deliver on its promising concept. The reviewer had high hopes for the idea of a found-footage film told from the perspective of a dash cam, imagining a thrilling and chaotic portrayal of an alien infection outbreak. However, the actual film falls far short of these expectations, with the deputy driving around in circles, encountering only a few infected individuals who simply stand there, and a 15-minute shot where nothing happens. The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and dismissive, with phrases like ""Holy crap, what a bomb"" and ""Stay away!!!"" emphasizing their strong negative opinion.

The reviewer also takes a personal stance, stating that they are done watching Albert Pyun's films after sitting through 20 subpar movies. This suggests that the reviewer has had enough of Pyun's work and is not willing to give him another chance.

6028,"Jesus Christ, what the hell happened here?. This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen, how is it possible that they screwed up such a nice idea for a movie. To tell you the truth I was so hyped for this, I though it was like Blair Witch but with actual alien creatures chasing the camera guy. Goddamn it, I have been reduced to fast forwarding this pile of sh*t, and I never do that while seeing movies. The high rating here on IMDb makes me believe that actual aliens are giving 10's for this piece of crap.<br /><br />Invasion is about well, an invasion. The movie starts by saying that everything you're about to see is real, blahblahblah. Then they go and tell me about a special camera system used in cars, as if I need to believe their bullsh*t to enjoy this movie. Next thing you know I'm seeing the most boring car driving ever filmed, in a forest at night mind you. Is this a movie, or a Disney theme park ride? The first 20 minutes is all boring dialog between cops while seeing grass and one straight road with a flashlight. Where the hell were the aliens?! They were sleeping of course! Then we learn that bad acting is not only reduced to high school plays, as the cop behind the camera goes out of his car to look for a missing man who was 'nightfishing' and had stumbled upon a mysterious meteorite. I wonder what happens to him? Out of nowhere, we see the 'nightfishing' guy walking like a zombie. The cop is apparently too dumb to notice that something is wrong with this man. Apparently he was indeed dumb, as the zombie/alien guy injects in the cop's ear some sort of alien parasite, thus changing him into an alien. Then the cop/alien goes back into his car, looks for a young couple that were having sex a while back in the forest, gets to them, changes the guy into an alien, and then the girl runs to the cop's car and escapes. If this quick plot introduction didn't get it in your head that this movie was bad, then the following 40 minutes will. Watching this movie is as painful as stabbing yourself repeatedly with a plastic fork. The script, while it may sound interesting on the back of the DVD box, is badly directed and sadly, we are left with another boring straight to DVD atrocity.<br /><br />The only thing that kept me awake were the constant flashing and loud sound effects (lamentably). If seeing the same forest trail for 63 minutes is not enough, we must endure crappy flashing techniques to ""scare"" the viewer and constant wailing of a bad actress that gets old and annoying pretty quick.<br /><br />If you feel you must rent this, I say to you, why? There are better SciFi/Horror films out there. Even the dreaded remake of the Invasion of the Body Snatchers is more entertaining than this. For the love of all things good, don't bother with his crap. My eyes bled, and for the first time, I wanted suicide.

The reviewer's tone is one of utter disgust and frustration, with a healthy dose of sarcasm and ridicule. The reviewer expresses their initial excitement and anticipation for the film, only to be thoroughly disappointed and bored by the experience. They criticize the film's pacing, calling the first 20 minutes ""boring"" and the entire movie a ""pile of sh*t"". The reviewer also mocks the film's attempts at creating tension and scares, calling the flashing and loud sound effects ""painful"" and the actress's wailing ""annoying"".

The reviewer's language is peppered with insults and hyperbole, with phrases like ""what the hell happened here?"", ""actual aliens are giving 10's for this piece of crap"", and ""my eyes bled, and for the first time, I wanted suicide"".

The reviewer's criticism is not limited to the film's entertainment value; they also criticize the script, direction, and acting, calling the script ""badly directed"" and the acting ""crappy"". The reviewer concludes by warning others to avoid the film, calling it a ""straight to DVD atrocity"" and giving it a score of 1/10.

6029,"Before going any further, I have to admit that I only saw the first episode of this show. If I had the time, I might have considered watching it every week, if only to see how the season played out. However, it was very clear to me from the beginning that Martha Stewart's version of ""The Apprentice"" just doesn't ""fit in."" Martha Stewart made a career of being a happy homemaker, a domestic diva of the likes of Oprah Winfrey and Julia Child. It was only since her scandalous legal troubles and subsequent incarceration that her public image began to reflect the true roughness of her character. Sure, she was compelling for a while, and this entire series poses the interesting question of what it means to be a woman in business. Does she have to come off as cold and tough? Shouldn't she?<br /><br />But the truth was, by the time Stewart came out of prison, her attempts for a public comeback, though certainly warranted, were never going to seize viewers' interest for very long. Perhaps a true comeback would have worked had she returned home peacefully and waited a year or so after her often mocked ankle bracelet was removed. Instead, she frantically dove into overkill with 2 series at once, the other being her syndicated daytime series Martha, much like her old show, but more mainstream, with famous guests like Bette Midler. Of course, even at her peak Stewart was never mainstream, so it's too much to ask that American audiences immediately accept her foray into reality TV. Maybe America wants Stewart to make a comeback on her own rather than be the basis for it.<br /><br />The show was basically a tired retread of Trump's ""Apprentice,"" which still holds my interest, depending on the tasks, the cast, and Trump's firing decisions (often controversial - likely for that reason). The letter bit was certainly not cliché but obnoxious in the least. The fact that Stewart never says, ""You're fired!"" - mentioned in the message board on this site - is particularly distressing. Producer Mark Burnett should be admired for dealing with Stewart's jail time honestly while trying to make her a hero, but the truth is that anyone watching can tell that she's basically trying to put on a show of being this nice businesswoman. Again never mainstream, Stewart lacks the agreeability and identifiability of Oprah Winfrey and the admirable, charismatic ""toughness"" of Donald Trump. Yes, this can be a gender-biased assessment of her character, but I mean it to be more about the nature of her business.<br /><br />It comes as no shock that Stewart has been fired, but I wonder if they really always intended it to only last for one season?",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is largely negative, expressing disappointment and skepticism towards Martha Stewart's version of ""The Apprentice"". The reviewer questions Stewart's ability to fit into the reality TV format, citing her background as a ""happy homemaker"" and ""domestic diva"" rather than a business mogul. The reviewer suggests that Stewart's public image has been tarnished by her legal troubles and incarceration, making her attempts at a comeback seem insincere.

The reviewer criticizes the show for being a ""tired retread"" of Donald Trump's ""Apprentice"", with Stewart lacking the charisma and agreeability of Trump or Oprah Winfrey. The reviewer also finds Stewart's persona to be inauthentic, trying to present herself as a nice businesswoman despite her rougher edges. The show's format, including the letter bit, is also panned as obnoxious.

The reviewer's tone is somewhat sympathetic, acknowledging that Stewart's comeback attempts may have been premature and that she may have been better off waiting longer to return to the public eye. However, the overall assessment is that the show was doomed from the start, and Stewart's firing comes as no surprise.

6031,"This is the second adaptation of Charlotte Armstrong by Claude Chabrol for the screen:the first was "" la rupture"" (1970)(from novel ""the balloon man"" )and it's really a pity no one cares about it.It's Chabrol's sleeper,and I urge any of his fans to see it.<br /><br />""The chocolate"" cobweb was not that strong a detective story to begin with.I read it 20 years ago and forgot all about it.The movie promises some good things at first,though,then finally disappoints to a fault.This is a confusing Chabrol movie,mixing elements of the heyday (circa 1969),and a lotta tongue-in-chick stuff coming from the eighties ,the likes of 'poulet au vinaigre"",not one particularly memorable work.<br /><br />Part of the disappointment comes from the cast:this is a distressingly poor gathering:Jacques Dutronc plays like a zombie,Isabelle Huppert reveals herself a somewhat limited actress,finally rather vulgar .It worked in ""une affaire de femme"",it does not here.They are not supported by the young couple :both are bland and unremarkable.Actors from the past,say,Stephane Audran or Michel Bouquet(both in ""la rupture"") were brilliant and contributed to Chabrol's then unique atmosphere.<br /><br />The story itself is undistinguished:beginning as some kind of ""serious"" ""la vie est un long fleuve tranquille "" (besides,a character hints at Etienne Chatilliez's very funny movie),the movie drags on and on as a laughable psychological drama afterwards.We will not congratulate the young female pianist ,who,after all she learned about her wicked hostess,agrees to drive a car along a dangerous road.<br /><br />Because he makes too many movies,Chabrol frequently releases turkeys.One wonder why people who wants to watch one of his movies should choose this one among all his stuff up for grabs.<br /><br />It seems that Chabrol's bourgeoise satire has finally given way to leniency.In ""la rupture"" the first Armstrong adaptation-an average detective story which Chabrol completely transcended-,you should hear Audran say ""they have so much money!"".Here ,Chabrol has lost his bite,his strength.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, expressing disappointment and frustration with Claude Chabrol's adaptation of Charlotte Armstrong's ""The Chocolate Cobweb"". The reviewer starts by mentioning that Chabrol's earlier adaptation, ""La Rupture"", was a superior work, and that this film is a ""turkey"" compared to his other films. The reviewer criticizes the cast, stating that Jacques Dutronc and Isabelle Huppert underperform, and that the young couple is ""bland and unremarkable"". The story is also panned, with the reviewer calling it ""undistinguished"" and ""laughable"" as a psychological drama.

The reviewer's tone is one of disappointment and disillusionment, suggesting that Chabrol has lost his edge and bite in this film. The comparison to ""La Rupture"" serves to highlight the shortcomings of ""The Chocolate Cobweb"", and the reviewer implies that Chabrol's prolific output has led to a decline in quality.

6032,"I did not like this film at all: The scenario is boring - and after a while, its primitive predictability really gets on your nerves.

The criticism extends to the characterization of Mika, which the reviewer finds unimpressive, even considering the director's experience.

The reviewer starts by acknowledging the promising premise, where the protagonist, Jeanne, investigates a potential connection to a famous pianist, André Polonski. However, the review quickly turns critical, stating that the film's familiar plot has been done better elsewhere. The character of Mika Muller, played by Isabelle Huppert, is deemed uninteresting and lacking clear motives, which diminishes the audience's emotional investment.

The reviewer also criticizes the piano scenes, calling them fake and unnecessary, as they fail to provide insight into the characters. Instead, they seem to only prolong the film's duration. The overall tone of the review is one of disappointment, particularly since the director, Chabrol, is expected to produce better work.

6034,"The French either make pro-Marxist films or anti-Marxist films - with a few in between. ""Merci pour le chocolat"" is the latter of this genre. From the opening credits telling the viewer what music is going to be played and by whom it was who composed you know that you are going to be swathed in middle class pretension. It is an old man's film with an excess of 40's plus people. It is also directed by an old man along with an old crew who have nothing to say about life to the viewer. The plot is not only banal but preposterous. How many films reveal the plot through dialogue only to repeat the same message via flashback some five minutes later? Maybe the director and actors had a low retentive capacity? In truth their is no tenable plot at all. It is riddle with holes like a good piece of French cheese.<br /><br />Whether intentional or not, it is a film about the bourgeoisie. At least a third of the film focuses on the piano and the pretentious twaddle espoused in each scene. I concede it has some well framed shots though they couldn't have used a steady-cam in this film - it would have woke them all up! Other than it being a nonsense story, the film allows the upper middle class to parade their values and vanity in a very comfortable Swiss location. A telling line of the film is when Rodolphe Pauly tells Anna Mouglalis that she need not lock her car while in the resort! Oh dear me.<br /><br />On the DVD, Miss Huppert makes a comment about shedding a false tear for a scene. Smirking she says: ""Like they do in the American Actor's Studio!"" I think Miss Huppert and the rest of the cast could learn well from the Actor's Studio.<br /><br />If there is one statement that stand out in my mind it is when Huppert remarks 'we are having friends for the weekend and all the servants are away'. No doubt they had all escaped from the mind numbing set lest they be associated with such an appalling film.<br /><br />Safety Medical Note.

The reviewer perceives the film as pretentious, old-fashioned, and catering to the bourgeoisie, with a plot that is ""banal"" and ""preposterous."" The reviewer criticizes the film's excessive focus on the piano and the upper-middle-class values and vanity on display. The dialogue is also ridiculed, with the reviewer suggesting that the actors and director may have had a ""low retentive capacity"" due to the repetitive and unnecessary exposition.

The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and dismissive, with personal jabs at the cast, particularly Isabelle Huppert, and the director. The reviewer even takes issue with a minor detail, such as the incorrect treatment of a hot water scald, implying that the film is incompetent in multiple aspects.

6035,"The dominating conflict is between a couple of fine actors (Huppert and Dutronc) and the horrible script. Evidently, the actors lost, since the director/screenwriter Claude Chabrol eventually forced the leading couple to follow this worthless piece of sick imagination to the letter. Fortunately, the powerful performances by Huppert and Dutronc dramatically improve the overall quality of the movie, which miraculously gains the depth and humor. As for Chabrol's persistence in keeping the film bland and illogical, it reaches the climax in the final scene, which is so incredibly poor that you will wonder which pills he was taking himself while directing it.",Negative,Negative,Negative,negative,"This review is largely negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with the film's script and direction.

The reviewer expresses disappointment with the lack of chemistry between the actors, describing their performances as ""frozen"" and, at times, ""amateur."" This suggests that the cast failed to bring the necessary energy and passion to their roles, resulting in an unengaging viewing experience. Furthermore, the script is panned for being ""not convincing"" and ""not reliable,"" implying that the narrative is poorly constructed and lacks credibility.

The reviewer's tone is one of disappointment and frustration, implying that the film had potential but failed to deliver. The criticism is not limited to a single aspect of the film, but rather encompasses the overall production, including the acting, script, and possibly even direction.

The reviewer disputes the film's classification as a thriller, stating that it lacks any thrilling elements. Instead, they describe the movie as dull, with an excessive focus on piano sounds and mundane conversations that fail to engage the audience. The reviewer's tone is sarcastic, as evident in their description of the film's most ""action-packed"" moment, which involves a spilled can of hot chocolate.

The reviewer also criticizes the acting, implying that the performers are not genuinely acting, but rather simply playing piano and engaging in small talk. The reviewer's anger and disappointment are palpable, as they express regret over wasting their time and money on the film. The fact that this movie motivated them to create an IMDb account to warn others about it further emphasizes their strong negative reaction.

6039,"For any wrestling fan, this is the wrestlemania to forget. No logic to the matches, some garbage gimmicks (doink the clown, and the Giant Gonzalez) this was a forgettable PPV something rare for the WWE(F).

6040,"I liked the whole set up with Ceasar's Palace, the Roman guards, and announcers in togas. This event also marked ""the passing of the torch"" as far as the voice of the WWF goes. Gorilla Monsoon who had done the play by play for every WWF PPV up to this point opens up and gives the typical introduction making it look like he's there to announce another PPV. But then introduces Jim Ross who is making his WWF debut and JR continues to do the WWF commentary to this day. But outside of that, this event is pure garbage. Good ol scientific wrestling has been thrown out the window and enter the birth of gimmicks. This to me was the event that the WWF started to go down the toilet, and didn't recover until the attitude era of the late 90's. Here's a review of the event.<br /><br />IC title match: Tatanka (Challenger) vs. Shawn Michaels (champ): An okay opener, but given what Shawn is capable of, it was very disappointing. I have no idea why the WWF was hell bent on putting Tatanka over. They should of realized that Shawn was the future and Tatanka was just some hyper wrestler in an Indian Gimick. The ending of the match itself was very lame. Shawn grabs the ref and pulls him out, then gets called for a count out. While it was fun watching Sherri get beat up afterwords, this match just was forgettable. Shawn had to carry this match and had trouble doing it.<br /><br />The Stenier Brothers vs. The Headshrinkers: Steiners get the win via a Franknsteiner. This match had it's moments, but the crowd just didn't seem into it. There was no heat behind it, I think it was a match just to throw two tag teams in.<br /><br />Crush vs. Doink the Clown: TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE! This match completely sucked. Two very lame gimmicks. A clown and a Hawaiian dressed in bizarre colors. The ending caught everybody by surprise. In the upcoming months, Crush turned heel and Doink turned face, but none of the fans seem to care. Sadly, this was not the worst match on the card.<br /><br />Razor Ramon vs. Bob Backland: You got a brand new heel that is very over going against a wrestler who was forgotten about 10 years ago. The fans snicker and laugh when Backlund comes out. And like Hogan/Rock in WM18 and HHH/Owen in WM14, the heel wrestler gets louder cheers in the face. Thankfully this match was short. The right guy won, but I wish they had Razor totally beat the crap out of and squash Backlund rather than winning by a small package out of nowhere.<br /><br />Tag Team Champion Match: Ted Dibiase and IRS (Champs) vs. Hulk Hogan & Brutus Beefcake w/Jimmy Hart I still would like to know the full story on what happened to Hogan's eye. Oh well. The crowd was really into this match, but it had no flow to it what so ever. Hogan and Beefcake were clearly suffering ring rust given that both wrestlers had been on the shelf for at least a year. Dibiase, being the great technical wrestler that he was, did help to carry the match from being a complete waste. The ending was a surprise with Dibiase and IRS getting the win via DQ. But to please the crowd, Hogan and Beefcake did their usual playing to the crowd at the end like they had won the match.<br /><br />Lex Luger vs. Mr. Perfect: The best part of this match was the four hot chicks that accompanied Lex Luger to the ring. Other than that, this was completely forgettable. The Mr. Perfect gimmick was born for a heel role and he just lacked the heat as a face. And Luger is just a waste of time no matter what gimmick he's in. Luger wins via a backslide despite that Perfect's feet were in the ropes. Then Perfect spends the post match getting his butt kicked. First Luger knocks him out with the running elbow. Then when Perfect regains consciousness he goes back to the dressing room to find Luger only to get the crap beaten out of him by Shawn Michaels, setting up an HBK/Perfect feud that had the potential to be a classic but the WWF misused.<br /><br />The Undertaker vs. Giant Gonzales: ABSOLUTE CRAP!! What was the WWF thinking bringing in such a horrible wrestler as Giant Gonzales. Sure he had size, but I'd rather watch the Brooklyn Brawler in a match than him. This isn't even worth commenting on.<br /><br />WWF CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH: Bret Hart (champ) vs. Yokozuna (challenger) You have one of the greatest technical wrestlers of all time going against a guy who's only advantage is that he's a gigantic lard ass. Bret was able to carry the match, but a rather predictable ending with Mr. Fuji throwing salt in Bret's face.<br /><br />POST MATCH: Yokozuna vs. Hulk Hogan Pure crap right here. Hogan comes down to the ring for no apparent reason and Mr. Fuji challenges him to a match after Yoko just won the title. Even the die-hard Hulkamaniacs find this to be total BS.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with the event.

The reviewer specifically criticizes the IC title match between Tatanka and Shawn Michaels, calling it ""lame"" and stating that Michaels had to carry the match. The reviewer also pans the Crush vs. Doink the Clown match, calling it ""TERRIBLE!"" and stating that both gimmicks were lame. The reviewer also expresses disappointment with the Razor Ramon vs. Bob Backlund match, stating that it was too short and didn't allow Razor to fully showcase his skills.

The reviewer also criticizes the tag team championship match, stating that it had no flow and that Hogan and Beefcake were rusty from being out of the ring for a year. The reviewer also expresses disappointment with the Lex Luger vs. Mr. Perfect match, calling it ""completely forgettable"" and stating that Luger is a waste of time in any gimmick. The reviewer also pans the Undertaker vs. Giant Gonzales match, calling it ""ABSOLUTE CRAP!!"" and stating that Gonzales was a horrible wrestler.

The reviewer also criticizes the WWF championship match between Bret Hart and Yokozuna, stating that it was predictable and that Yokozuna's only advantage was his size. The reviewer also expresses frustration with the post-match segment, where Yokozuna challenges Hogan to a match, calling it ""total BS.""

Overall, the reviewer's tone is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with the event as a whole.

6041,"1993 was a time of change in the WWE but for this Wrestlemania they decided to wind back the clock as Hulk Hogan returned, along with his good friend Brutus Beefcake, who had been out of wrestling since a paragliding accident in 1990.<br /><br />This was not a great event. Only two matches had any real build and the whole thing came off as being rushed. The in ring action wasn't great and the twist at the end, which I'll discuss later, really wasn't the earth shattering moment the WWE hoped it would be.<br /><br />This forgettable night started off with Shawn Micheals defending his Intercontinental Championship against the undefeated Tatanka. Tatanka had beaten Michaels a couple of times leading into the fight. Michaels had a new manager, Luna Vachon while Tatanka was accompanied by Michaels' former manager and future WWE Hall of Famer Sherri Martel. Tatanka won by DQ. Michaels kept his title and went straight back into his feud with Marty Janetty, which had been put on hold just for Wrestlemania. Why, I have no idea.<br /><br />Next up saw the Steiner Brothers (Scott and Rick) defeat the Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) with Scott scoring the pin after hitting Samu with the Frankensteiner. Good match.<br /><br />Doink the clown needed help from another clown to win his match against Crush. A second Doink distracting Crush when he was in complete control and allowing Doink to get the pin and the victory. Doink was an entertaining gimmick character, who got old rather quickly.<br /><br />Razor Ramon easily defeated the returning Bob Backlund in the next match.<br /><br />This brings us to the first in our double main event. As the Mega Maniacs Team of Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake, with the newly turned good guy Jimmy Hart in their corner, took on Hart's former buddies Money Inc (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R Shyster). This was a fairly sketchy finish. Beefcake, as mentioned, had been in a paragliding accident requiring full facial surgery and had wrestled the match with a face mask on. Shyster ripped the mask off him and beat Beefcake to a pulp. The ref went down, Hogan grabbed the face mask and knocked out DiBIase and Shyster and then Hart, who was wearing a referee shirt, counted the three. Another ref came down and reversed the decision, declaring Money Inc winners by DQ.<br /><br />Next up Lex Luger or the Narcissist as he was also known at the time defeated Mr Perfect. This match came about because Luger was being managed by Perfect's old manager Bobby Heenan. Perfect had is feet on the ropes when he was pinned, but the ref missed it.<br /><br />The Undertaker picked up a lacklustre DQ victory in a pretty poor match against the Giant Gonzales. THe Undertaker had earned the ire of Gonzales' manager Harvey Wippleman in 1992 and Taker had defeated his big monster Kamala at Survivor Series. Wippleman vowed revenge and took it at the Royal Rumble as Gonzales attacked Taker, costing him the match. Gonzales dominated Undertaker in this match, but was DQ'd for choking Taker out with chloroform. Weird finish to a bad match.<br /><br />This bought us to our main event as WWE Champion Bret Hart, seriously challenged as champion for the first time, put his title on the line against Mr Fuji's unstoppable monster Yokozuna. Yokozuna controlled the early going, but Hart resisted and then took control. He had Yokozuna in the sharpshooter, surely he would give in and Hart would be established as an heroic hero after taking out the big monster. But Fuji had other ideas, throwing salt in Hart's face, rendering the Canadian helpless as Yokozuna got the pin.<br /><br />What a downer ending. But wait here comes Hulk Hogan. He's checking Hart to make sure he's OK. Suddenly Fuji challenges Hogan to a WWE Title right then and there. Hogan accepts. Fuji throws salt towards Hogan, but hits Yokozuna instead. Hogan hits the leg drop and wins the match and the title. What did I just watch? And so, what most fans thought was going to be the night we either saw Hart establish himself as a giant killer, or Yokozuna establish himself as an unstoppable monster, we instead saw Hulk Hogan pick up a meaningless title win. A title that he would not defend for three months. As a matter of fact this was the only match Hogan wrestled for the WWE before the King of the Ring PPV in June 1993.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review of WrestleMania IX is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer expresses disappointment with the event, stating that only two matches had any real build-up and that the whole event felt rushed. The in-ring action is described as not being great, and the twist at the end, which saw Hulk Hogan win the WWE Championship, is seen as unimpressive and meaningless. The reviewer questions the logic behind the booking decisions, such as Shawn Michaels' feud with Marty Jannetty being put on hold for no apparent reason.

The review also criticizes the individual matches, with the exception of the Steiner Brothers vs. Headshrinkers match, which is described as ""good."" The rest of the matches are seen as lacking, with the main event between Bret Hart and Yokozuna being particularly disappointing due to the sudden and unexplained appearance of Hulk Hogan, which led to a hasty and unfulfilling title change.

The reviewer's tone is one of frustration and disappointment, with a sense of ""what did I just watch?"" The event is seen as a whole as being poorly executed and lacking in excitement or memorable moments.

The reviewer also criticizes the storyline, calling it ""poor"" and stating that it was obvious that Hulk Hogan's black eye was a result of a real-life altercation with Macho Man Randy Savage, rather than the in-storyline explanation.

The reviewer also expresses their distaste for the event's aesthetic, specifically the decision to have WWE employees dress up as Egyptian gods, which they find ridiculous. They mention that the sight of Jim Ross in a gown still gives them nightmares. The only positive comment made is about Bobby Heenan, who they found funny.

The main event, featuring Bret Hart and Yokozuna, is described as ""very boring,"" and the reviewer seems unimpressed by the outcome, which saw Yokozuna win after Mr. Fuji threw salt in Hart's face. The reviewer concludes by giving the event an overall grade of ""E,"" indicating a complete failure.

The reviewer's tone is scathing, with phrases like ""disgusting,"" ""failure,"" and ""humiliate themselves"" conveying a strong sense of disapproval. The reviewer's conclusion, that the creators should stop producing the show to avoid further embarrassment, reinforces the negative tone. Overall, the review is a harsh critique that suggests the show is beyond redemption.

6045,"I love how everyone treats this show like it was the next great American sitcom. I watched five episodes of this abomination, and the only person that came close to an actual teacher was the old guy that sort of loved and hated his job. The rest of them were just pretty people trying to read the lines written by people who never actually went inside of a real classroom. I loved how every episode consisted of the two idiots (one who got laid and the other who didn't) getting into some form of zany trouble that indirectly involved their students. The British girl who thought she found an likable quality in the main idiot, but in the end was somehow shocked that he turned out to be a jackass. The hot chick that was there for the particular purpose of being hot, and the principal and her lackey that served to somehow move the almost non-existent plot forward. I loved how almost all the teachers on this show were very young, but I ask you to think back to your high school days and remember the teachers that you had . . . did they look like that? Or did you go to the high school that had middle-aged people teaching in it? That is the high school that everyone else went to. The show lacked any form of research into what goes on in schools. In public schools, principals do not have the power to higher and fire teachers, the school board does, but in every episode that I watched the principal made threats to fire her teachers. Think back to your history class . . . . . or think of any history class, did you ever see an incredibly hot British chick teach an American History class? No. Did you ever see a teacher's lounge that is so huge that you could actually play basketball in? No.<br /><br />Teachers could have been a great show had it actually of based itself in some form of reality. What makes teaching funny is the stories that you get from interaction with students, and the teachers find it funny because they deal with the students day in and day out. The overemphasis on their lives outside of teaching just made it another four camera sitcom that had unrealistic people in an unrealistic environment saying unrealistic lines, and I'm sorry, I just didn't buy it. The show could have modeled itself after other currently successful sitcoms and used a single-camera format, and it should have centered more around the teacher's relationships with their students and not with each other.<br /><br />It gets a star for trying and a star for the hot chick (she was really hot).<br /><br />In the end, it was a failed sitcom that will go down in history as a hacks attempt to understand a profession. I only hope that if they make another sitcom based on teaching that they learn from their mistakes so that a monstrosity such as this never touches the television screen.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing strong disappointment and frustration with the TV show ""Teachers"". The reviewer's main criticism is that the show lacks any semblance of realism, with characters that are unrealistic and unrelatable, and a portrayal of the teaching profession that is inaccurate and misleading. The reviewer argues that the show's focus on the personal lives of the teachers, rather than their relationships with their students, is a major flaw, and that the show's reliance on unrealistic and zany plotlines makes it feel like a generic, unfunny sitcom.

The reviewer also takes issue with the show's lack of research and understanding of the teaching profession, pointing out inaccuracies such as the principal's ability to hire and fire teachers, and the unrealistic portrayal of the teachers' lounge. The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and dismissive, with a sense of disappointment and frustration that the show failed to capture the humor and reality of the teaching profession.

The only positive comments made are a backhanded compliment about one of the actresses being ""really hot"", but even this is not enough to redeem the show in the reviewer's eyes. Overall, the review is a scathing critique of the show, with the reviewer concluding that it is a ""failed sitcom"" that will be remembered as a ""hack's attempt to understand a profession"".

6046,"I was watching TV one day with a friend and we caught the last twenty minutes of ""Going Bananas."" Believe me when I say it was enough to get a good judgment of the film. The first scene that I saw was the monkey, the kid, the fat guy, and the black guy who looked like Dave Chappelle, flying around in a crop duster thousands of feet in the air. While everyone else was solemn about the journey, the monkey seemed to be on some kind of drug binge where he kept shouting something that resembled the English word faster. They then landed on a twenty yard long dock in Africa. After a heart felt goodbye where the monkey cried (Hahahaha), the ""villains"" of the film appeared. They were tearing complete ass in their vintage Cadillac when the evil monkey took an Air Jordan leap form the dock onto the boat that was sailing away a clean 40 yards away and made them sink their beautiful car into the Pacific Ocean. After seeing this film, I have a new purpose in life; to find the midget who played the monkey and stab him in the eye with a fountain pen.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is a scathing critique of the film ""Going Bananas"". The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and mocking, with a clear disdain for the movie. They claim that the last 20 minutes of the film were enough to form a judgment, implying that the rest of the movie couldn't be any better. The reviewer ridicules the plot, characters, and action scenes, using phrases like ""Hahahaha"" and ""tearing complete ass"" to convey their amusement and disdain. They also express a desire to harm the actor who played the monkey, which is an exaggeration meant to emphasize their dislike for the film.

The reviewer's language is playful and humorous, but the underlying sentiment is overwhelmingly negative. They seem to be poking fun at the film's absurdity and lack of coherence, implying that it's a waste of time. The tone is lighthearted, but the criticism is severe, suggesting that the reviewer has no redeeming words for the movie.

6047,"A good friend of mine one said: ""A monkey is funny, anytime, anywhere."" There is one exception to this: GOING BANANAS. It is quite simply the WORST MOVIE I have ever seen. It's worse than PLAN 9, worse than THE BEAST OF YUCCA FLATS. It is TERRIBLE. The talking monkey gag gets old after about three minutes, and believe me that's all there is. Make sure you have a bunch of people around to revive you after you go into TOXIC SHOCK from GOING BANANAS, the worst movie ever.",Negative,negative,negative,negative,"This review is an unbridled expression of disdain and disgust towards the film ""Going Bananas"". The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and hyperbolic, with phrases like ""the WORST MOVIE I have ever seen"" and ""the worst movie ever"" emphasizing their strong negative opinion. The comparison to infamous low-budget films like ""Plan 9"" and ""The Beast of Yucca Flats"" further reinforces the reviewer's belief that ""Going Bananas"" is a cinematic abomination. The reviewer's criticism focuses on the repetitive and unfunny use of a talking monkey gag, implying that the film's humor is shallow and quickly becomes tiresome.

The reviewer's use of dramatic language, such as ""TOXIC SHOCK"", adds to the comedic effect of the review, but also underscores the reviewer's genuine distaste for the film. The overall tone is one of ridicule and warning, with the reviewer cautioning potential viewers to avoid the film at all costs.

6048,"I somehow failed for a few years to see this film, although it has been quite successful and generated a lot of discussions in Israel. I am sorry that I did not postpone indefinitely seeing it.<br /><br />The theme of 'Kadosh' is a very real and painful one for those who know the Jewish religious world - the place of women in the orthodox family and society. The basic situation that sits at the premises of the film is possible, the problem is that the way it is brought to screen and the 'solution' that the conflicts described receives in the movie is wrong. Gitai does not seem to have too much sympathy for men in the religious world, but his approach of picking characters that are either fanatic, or unable to express their human feeling makes the whole story seem simplistic. Neither does he a much better service to his women characters, although here at least he shows more sympathy and he also enjoys the participation of two beautiful and gifted actresses in Yael Abecassis and Meital Barda. Overall Gitai's vision is too one-sided, his cinema means are too basic, he focuses on the technical details of the Jewish religious life, which may be interesting for people who do not know them but are really not relevant at all in the context of the whole story. Starting from interesting premises what we get here is a boring film which seems longer than it is, with a very static way of acting, obsessive use of music that plays in the same register not only from a musical but also from an emotional perspective and a very inconclusive if not even confusing ending. What difference between this film and 'Ha Ushpizin' inspired from and describing the very same social landscape and which succeeded to transmit human feelings on the screen. In 'Kadosh' there are both too little cinema and too little human emotions.",Negative,negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, criticizing the film ""Kadosh"" for its simplistic and one-sided portrayal of the Orthodox Jewish community. The reviewer argues that the film's approach to exploring the theme of women's roles in Orthodox society is flawed, with poorly developed characters and an overly simplistic narrative. The reviewer specifically criticizes the film's portrayal of men as either fanatical or emotionally repressed, and women as one-dimensional characters. The reviewer also criticizes the film's technical aspects, such as the overuse of music and the static acting style, which makes the film feel longer than it is.

The reviewer's disappointment is further emphasized by comparing ""Kadosh"" unfavorably to another film, ""Ha Ushpizin"", which successfully conveyed human emotions and explored the same social landscape. The reviewer concludes that ""Kadosh"" lacks both cinematic flair and emotional resonance, resulting in a boring and inconclusive film.

6049,"The one line summary is actually the punch line of a very old joke that begins ""what is a Jewish porno film?""<br /><br />While this film had its interesting moments, it was far too slow moving and did not do enough to explain to those of us in the audience unfamiliar with orthodox Jewish custom, exactly what was going on and why? How many people who came across this film would know that the bathtub the female characters were washing in is in reality called a ""Mikveh"" which is a ritual bath used to cleanse spiritual uncleanliness? The same question might be asked of why the bride was walked around the groom a dizzying number of times while her face was covered just prior to the marriage vows being performed. These two examples are but two of a large number of such moments that remained completely unexplained to the uninitiated audience.<br /><br />This film does have its touching moments along with expressions of great love and emotions. The characters are presented very authentically right down to the number of garments an ultra orthodox Jewish male must wear as well as the religious rituals he must engage in upon awakening in the morning to begin his day. The attitudes orthodox Judaism has towards women in general and wives in particular is both intriguing and at times maddening. This is another reason why more explanation is needed if this story is to be understood in context.<br /><br />I recommend this film to people who are familiar with orthodox Jewish tradition and ritual as well as those who might be interested in getting a brief peek at what the lives of people who practice this way of life is like.<br /><br />The story itself about two sisters who in their own ways rebel against ""the system"" is of moderate interest at best.",Negative,"Mixed, but leaning towards ""negative"".",Negative,negative,"This review is mixed, but leaning towards a negative perspective. The reviewer expresses frustration with the film's pacing, stating that it is ""far too slow moving."" They also criticize the film for not providing sufficient explanation of Orthodox Jewish customs and rituals, leaving audience members unfamiliar with these practices confused. The reviewer highlights specific examples, such as the use of a Mikveh (ritual bath) and the bride's circling of the groom, which are not adequately explained. This lack of context makes it difficult for viewers without prior knowledge of Orthodox Judaism to fully understand the story.

On the other hand, the reviewer acknowledges the film's authentic portrayal of Orthodox Jewish characters, including their attire and daily rituals. They also appreciate the exploration of the attitudes towards women in Orthodox Judaism, finding it both intriguing and, at times, maddening. The reviewer recommends the film to those familiar with Orthodox Jewish tradition or those interested in gaining insight into this way of life.

However, the reviewer's overall assessment of the story is lukewarm, describing it as being of ""moderate interest at best."" This, combined with the criticisms of pacing and lack of explanation, suggests that the reviewer's negative comments outweigh the positive aspects.

6050,"Here is a film which clearly banks on being marketed as exotica to audiences unfamiliar with its subject matter.<br /><br />An attempted hybrid of fiction and document, ""Kadosh"" clumsily falls in between the chairs. As a documentary, on the one hand, it is neither accurate nor insightful. To realize its sloppy handling of detail, one needs to go no further than the opening scene where it is quite obvious that the ultra-orthodox protagonist does not know even so much as how to properly put on his t'filin. More generally, the tedious rote-style presentation of details (in this case of Jewish ultra-orthodox ritual) is the role of a manual, not of a good documentary; the latter should provide an organizing principle (a gestalt, if you will) for the viewer, so that she may emerge with a better understanding of the viewed. This clearly does not happen here, as ultra-orthodox ritual is being made even more enigmatic. The director seems to have done a decent job explaining it all verbally during the film's release campaign; cinematically, however, this is a severe case of stuttering. As a fiction-feature, on the other hand, it suffers from flatness of character, simplicity of plot and bluntness of message. At some points I felt I was watching a cartoon. (e.g. the wedding night consummation scene - without going in detail into angles, positions and dimensions ... well, technically this could not possibly be a realistic portrayal of human sex, savage as it may be.)<br /><br />There are no subtleties in this film. The clever manipulation of hints, stimulating the viewer's imagination and thought into taking an active part in the cinematic text, which I believe is a mark of a good feature, is completely absent. On the contrary: watching the movie I felt, at times, as being force-fed again and again with the same already chewed-up and way-too-obvious content. It is, indeed, as director Gitai himself put it in an interview, an architectural ""shifting objects in space"", and then coloring the scenes with the appropriate emotions when called for and advancing the plot on its appropriate and predictable track; but the spark, that creative, duende-like dark, inarticulable spark (let's not forget ""Kadosh"" is supposedly a tragedy), that which casts on a two-dimensional screen the spell which turns it into an extension of the viewers world, is missing without a trace. Perhaps a work of a visual-engineer, perhaps of an unsophisticated ideologue; definitely not of a true filmmaker. What I saw was a passion-play for animated issues rather than flesh-blood-and-complexities real people. The acting, by and large, failed to transcend this directorial flatness of an idea forced (at times even tortured) into film. One notable, though relatively minor, exception was that of the mikve-lady and the mother, both played by the excellent and seasoned Lea Koenig.<br /><br />It takes more than strict adherence to a winning formula (namely, a serving of exotica, plus heart wrenching yet simple melodrama, plus a popular agenda, preferably politically correct) to tantalize my interest buds. The bottom line here, all being said, is that for a considerable portion of the movie I was simply bored. In spite of the novel, perhaps even pioneering achievement of using an ultra-orthodox neighborhood as a movie set, for which Mr. Gitai and his crew deserve all praise, I found ""Kadosh"" way too Nadosh (Hebrew for ""trite"").",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with the film ""Kadosh"". The reviewer criticizes the film's attempt to blend documentary and fiction, arguing that it fails to deliver on both fronts. The documentary aspects are deemed inaccurate and lacking in insight, while the fictional elements are panned for their flat characters, simplistic plot, and heavy-handed message. The reviewer also takes issue with the film's lack of subtlety, feeling that it force-feeds the audience with obvious and simplistic content.

The reviewer's tone is scathing, with phrases like ""clumsily falls in between the chairs"", ""sloppy handling of detail"", ""tedious rote-style presentation"", and ""flatness of character"" conveying a strong sense of disappointment and frustration. The reviewer also makes sarcastic remarks, such as comparing the film's portrayal of sex to a cartoon and calling the director a ""visual-engineer"" or ""unsophisticated ideologue"" rather than a true filmmaker. The only positive comment is a brief mention of the excellent performance of Lea Koenig.

The reviewer's conclusion is that the film is boring and lacks depth, with the novel setting of an ultra-orthodox neighborhood being the only redeeming feature. The final sentence, ""I found 'Kadosh' way too Nadosh (Hebrew for 'trite')"", drives home the reviewer's negative assessment of the film.

6051,"As a writer and a lapsed Orthodox Jewish woman, I was let down tremendously by this movie. The dialogue is hackneyed and wasteful, the characters, too engaged with lines ranging from the wrackingly prosaic to the stunningly melodramatic, aren't allowed to expand into genuinely textured individuals. The one-trick musical score tries to make up for the blandness, swooping portentously into the silence to jar the viewer and the script out of protracted catatonia.<br /><br />Like an adolescent revolutionary on a self-righteous tirade, this film is blown away by the wisdom of its revelation--patriarchy is wrong--and thoroughly squanders its energies, hammering on this point. The resultant artistic crime is a complete lack of imaginative development; the moral crime is the reduction of human beings to caricatures: martyrs and grotesques.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is a scathing critique of the film, written from the perspective of a lapsed Orthodox Jewish woman who was deeply disappointed by the movie. The reviewer's primary complaint is that the dialogue is clichéd and unoriginal, and the characters are underdeveloped and lack depth. The score is also criticized for being overly dramatic and trying to compensate for the film's overall blandness. The reviewer argues that the film's message, which appears to be a critique of patriarchy, is presented in a heavy-handed and simplistic way, lacking in nuance and imagination.

The reviewer's tone is one of frustration and disappointment, with a hint of anger at the film's failure to deliver a more thoughtful and sophisticated exploration of its themes. The use of strong language, such as ""hackneyed,"" ""wasteful,"" and ""stunningly melodramatic,"" emphasizes the reviewer's negative assessment of the film. The comparison of the film to an ""adolescent revolutionary"" also implies a sense of immaturity and lack of sophistication.

Overall, the review is extremely negative, with the reviewer expressing a strong sense of disappointment and frustration with the film's failure to deliver a more thoughtful and nuanced exploration of its themes.

6052,"The film is a gross misrepresentation of Orthodox lifestyle and practice. NEVER will a Jewish court enforce a divorce between childless couples. Although the concept exists in Jewish law, the conditions are too numerous for it to actually ever take place. Childless couples do find it difficult to cope with their childlessness in a community where children are a very important part of life, but nowhere are they ""rejected"" by their community as depicted in the film. They are treated with extreme sensitivity. In fact, many great Rabbis have lived their entire lives without children and never considered divorce.<br /><br />The depiction of Yosef, a horrible human being, is meant to - perhaps subconsciously - show the behavior of a typical orthodox male. In reality, it is as typical as a violent drunkard rapist is typical of secular society.

The reviewer also takes issue with the characterization of Yosef, labeling him as a ""horrible human being"" and arguing that he is not representative of typical Orthodox males.

The reviewer's tone is one of indignation and frustration, as they feel that the film perpetuates negative stereotypes and biases against the Orthodox community. They express surprise that people would form opinions about a community based on a biased and inaccurate film, rather than seeking out more informed and nuanced understanding.

6055,"The movie opens with a scene that simply could not be. A man wakes up and while his wife remains in bed, he begin his morning prayers in his bedroom while his wife sleeps peacefully. Morning blessings are recited, but only the ones Gitai finds controversial. the rest are conveniently omitted. then while in philactories and a tallis he kisses his wife good morning!! This is not an accurate depiction of jewish prayer in any home, let alone a chassidic home. Amos Gittai is not interested in accurately portraying chassidic life. He is interested in adding to his ever growing list of melodramatic and empty films. The mikka (ritual bath) scenes are far from accurate and his jewish wedding was laughable as it does not even approach the atmosphere of a chassidic wedding.

6056,"<br /><br />This movie is best enjoyed amidst a large audience with the giggle-fits.<br /><br />Very frequently the characters in KADOSH are seen staring ahead intensely at nothing. Very intense unhappy faces, very pensive, very serious. During these moments there is very serious sounding music just to make doublely sure the viewer realizes that the scene being watched is not about fun and games.<br /><br />The more entertaining portions of this film come in between the many pensive stares. We learn that the women of the KADOSH community have two duties. One is to breed as many male babies as possible for their husbands. The second is to stay employed so to free their husbands from having to work. What do these men do with their ample free time? They pray. And we learn that at home they pray out loud, ""I give you thanks for not creating me as a woman."" And at their place of worship they pray to give thanks for possessing functioning male genitalia.<br /><br />Along with the praying there are many scenes of frenzied antics, screaming, and endless head bobbing and bodies rocking back and fourth, and mixed in with everything are many intricate and bizarre (or simple but just as odd) ritualistic activities.<br /><br />The cream of the unintentional comedy comes from the sex. The imagery of an hot and bothered man actively exchanging body fluids with his wife in bed while attempting to keep his beanie from falling off his scalp is unforgettable!<br /><br />Every sex scene is funny, but one that stands out is when a husband rubs his face against his beautiful wife's (Yaël Abecassis) feet. Oh yes, we are finally entering the land of sensuality... but NO! The feet rubbing stops before anything happens and the husband begins his autistic looking head bobbing and body rocking until the scene ends!<br /><br />There are three attractive females in near states of undress, however KADOSH contains absolutely no nudity. Technically, there is some interesting imagery and pleasing uses of light and colors by the director.<br /><br />For a more believable, educational and entertaining treatment of the plight of being an unclean female unworthy of holding a book in a world where respect is measured by the speed by which a man can cite a phrase from ancient writings, I suggest Barbra Streisand's YENTL.<br /><br />",Negative,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is written in a sarcastic and humorous tone, with the reviewer poking fun at the film's serious and pensive moments, as well as its depiction of religious rituals and sexual encounters.

The reviewer also mocks the film's portrayal of the women's roles in the KADOSH community, highlighting their limited duties and the men's prayers of gratitude for not being women.

The review is filled with irony and sarcasm, with the reviewer finding unintentional humor in the film's attempts at drama and romance. The sex scenes, in particular, are ridiculed for their awkwardness and lack of sensuality. The reviewer's tone is playful and tongue-in-cheek, suggesting that the film is best enjoyed in a large audience where the absurdity of the scenes can be collectively laughed at.

The only positive comment made is about the film's visuals, with the reviewer acknowledging the director's use of light and color. However, this is quickly overshadowed by the reviewer's overall negative assessment of the film, with a final recommendation to watch Barbra Streisand's YENTL instead.

The reviewer, who appears to be familiar with the customs and laws of the religion depicted in the film, points out several specific scenes that they claim are flawed and disrespectful. They argue that the filmmakers demonstrate a profound ignorance of the religion and its practices, leading to a mockery of the laws and customs.

The reviewer's tone is one of outrage and frustration, with phrases like ""complete crock"" and ""scary what ignorance can concoct"" conveying a strong sense of disappointment and disillusionment. The level of detail in which the reviewer critiques the film, highlighting specific scenes and laws that are allegedly broken, suggests a deep understanding of the subject matter and a strong emotional investment in the accuracy of the representation.

6058,"And again, Columbia Pictures decides to merely make ""hash"" using the original version with Curly and without any of the gags or jokes to boot! Toward the end of this pitiful flick when Joe gets stuck riding the bull, the studio didn't even make much of an effort to re-record the sound for if you listen carefully you can still here Curly going ""Woo woo woo woo"". Also, when Moe and Larry throw the darts in order to ""slow the bull down so he can get off"", that's lifted right from the original because you can actually see Moe and Larry ""magically"" appear 15 years younger. Why oh why did Moe allow all this to happen? It's a burning question that probably can never be answered because as far as I know, in real life he was quite sensitive to any type of criticism and had rather high standards for his work, as also did Larry, Curly and Shemp. Don't waste your time on this one.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is extremely negative, expressing disappointment and frustration with Columbia Pictures' handling of a Three Stooges film. The reviewer is upset that the studio reused footage from an original version featuring Curly, but removed the humor and jokes, resulting in a subpar film. The reviewer points out specific examples of laziness, such as the lack of effort to re-record sound effects, allowing Curly's original ""Woo woo woo"" to be audible, and the reuse of scenes from the original film, including a scene where Moe and Larry appear 15 years younger. The reviewer questions why Moe, who was known for his high standards, allowed this to happen.

The tone of the review is scathing, with the reviewer advising readers to avoid wasting their time on this film. The language used is critical and disapproving, with phrases like ""pitiful flick"" and ""didn't even make much of an effort.""

6059,"This short subject is a remake of the Three Stooges' 1942 film ""What's the Matador?"", about the boys' trip to Mexico and their bullfighting adventures. Although the original short was made during the Stooges' peak period, it isn't that memorable and I believe it is one of the more mediocre films with Curly Howard.<br /><br />Having established that, I believe that ""Sappy Bullfighters"" is just pathetically awful, like all the other shorts with Joe Besser. Moe and Larry never should have hired Besser, because his whiny, almost feminine character was completely wrong for the violent comedy of the Stooges. His 16 films with Moe and Larry marked the nadir for the team, and those shorts are embarrassing to watch. This short was released in 1959 and was the team's swan song with Columbia. Maybe Besser was a nice guy, but he was all wrong as the third stooge.<br /><br />I won't review any more Besser shorts, because I would just be giving the same scathingly negative review over and over. Do yourself a big favor and don't watch this. Instead, try to catch ""In the Sweet Pie and Pie"" or ""Hoi Polloi"".",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is extremely negative, expressing strong disappointment and frustration with the short film ""Sappy Bullfighters"" and, more broadly, the entire series of films featuring Joe Besser as the third Stooge. The reviewer sets the tone by stating that the original 1942 film ""What's the Matador?"" is mediocre, but then proceeds to lambast the remake, calling it ""pathetically awful."" The primary criticism is directed at Joe Besser, whose character is deemed unsuitable for the Stooges' brand of violent comedy. The reviewer's disdain for Besser's performances is palpable, labeling his 16 films with Moe and Larry as the ""nadir"" of the team and ""embarrassing to watch.""

The reviewer's advice to avoid watching ""Sappy Bullfighters"" and instead opt for other, presumably better, Stooges shorts reinforces the negative sentiment. The tone is scathing, with no redeeming qualities mentioned about the film. The reviewer's reluctance to review more Besser shorts, fearing repetition of the same negative assessment, further underscores the strength of their disapproval.

6060,"The Three Stooges are arguably the greatest comedy team in film history. For that reason alone, they deserved a much better ending at Columbia than they received with this short.<br /><br />""Sappy Bullfighters"" is just not good. Granted, this is not all Joe Besser's fault. I personally feel that some of his shorts are fun enough, simply because of the departure from the Stooges usual fanfare that they contain, and for the fact that Larry is sometimes showcased more. However, this short just will not do. And the fact that one knows that it is their last short that was ever shown, well that just adds to the overall disgust.<br /><br />This film just epitomizes how short subjects were on their last dying breaths during this time and how little effort went into making them. This short is so sloppy. It is a simple re-make of a Curly short, ""What's the Matador?"", filmed years before. As if this fact wasn't bad enough, the studio actually threw in footage of Moe and Larry from the original (which was filmed nearly 20 years prior). Are these things not obvious? Laughable or sad? You be the judge.<br /><br />Another part of this short that makes it miserable is the fact that it is basically a Joe Besser showcase, with him showing that all he is (at least in this film) is a Curly-wanna-be-gone-completely-wrong! Moe and Larry have little to do in this short. As a Larry fan, I also must say that I feel it a bit disgraceful to have Besser get to use the joke that Larry originally popularized in the short ""Ants In The Pantry"". To see Besser say ""I can't see, I can't see!"" and have Larry say the simple ""Why can't you see?"", while Besser gets to quip ""I got my eyes closed"", is just wrong on all levels.<br /><br />The two brave soldiers who stuck it out for all those years, Howard and Fine, have so little to do in this short. There are hardly any funny bits with them. The only thing that qualifies is Larry hiding under the bed of a jealous husband, attempting to be ""Pepe"", his dog.<br /><br />One can't blame the dynamic duo. Larry and Moe give it their all. No matter how ridiculous things could get (and I'm sure they had their opinions by this point in their careers) Howard and Fine never gave anything less than their best. Their efforts do not pale from 1934-1959.<br /><br />I often enjoy many shorts that some will dismiss as horrible. I'm all for their more ""experimental"", unusual shorts. At least those contain new ideas. However, this short, I think everyone can agree, is just not good.<br /><br />Thank goodness TV later discovered the boys after the shorts department closed. Had they been forced to go out in THIS fashion, well that would have been a gross injustice to all the years they invested in making audiences laugh.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, expressing disappointment and frustration with the final short film featuring the Three Stooges, ""Sappy Bullfighters"". The reviewer believes that the Stooges deserved a better ending to their film career, but instead, they were given a subpar film that lacks effort and creativity. The reviewer criticizes the short for being a lazy remake of an earlier Curly short, ""What's the Matador?"", with the added insult of reusing footage from the original film. The reviewer also feels that Joe Besser, who joined the Stooges later in their career, is given too much screen time and attention, while Moe and Larry are relegated to minor roles.

The reviewer is particularly upset that Besser is given a joke that was originally popularized by Larry, and that the short lacks any truly funny moments. The reviewer praises Moe and Larry for giving their best efforts, despite the poor quality of the film. The reviewer concludes that ""Sappy Bullfighters"" is a disappointing and lackluster ending to the Stooges' film career, and that it's fortunate that they were later rediscovered on TV.

6061,"How pointless, hideous characters and boring film. Saved by brief sex scenes, mad witch, gorgeous desert island and Brooks body. The plot is tenuous, the characters are shallow and unlikeable. Having said that I did manage to watch it all, mainly because I was totally transfixed by the jiggling and kind of hoping that her character would come good in the end.

The only redeeming qualities mentioned are the brief sex scenes, the ""mad witch,"" the ""gorgeous desert island,"" and the physical appearance of Brooks.

6062,"A holiday on a boat, a married couple, an angry waiter and a shipwreck is the reason to this films beginning.<br /><br />I like boobs. No question about that. But when the main character allies with whoever happens to have the most fish at the moment, mostly by having sex with them and playing the role of the constant victim, my anger just rises to a whole new level. Take two guys (a husband and another man), put a pure bombshell woman in the middle of them, ad a deserted island, subtract all her moral issues, ad a whole bunch of moral issues to the men and mix it in a big bowl of arguments, fish and a zippo lighter and you will come up with a piece of junk movie like this. <br /><br />The acting is, I would say, good. There are some bloopers but not many as far as i could see. The main female character makes me sick. This is due to her lack of moral values. The man with the most fish get's her attention.

How can you justify having sex with another man for fish when your husband is 30feet away? And he won't even benefit from it? The female character has absolutely no problems to justify anything that she does. If she doesen't get approval for her actions, she's a victim.<br /><br />I recommend everyone to see this movie.

The reviewer also criticizes the film's plot, calling it a ""piece of junk"" and implying that it is shallow and lacking in substance.

Despite mentioning that the acting is ""good"" and that there are few bloopers, the reviewer's overall tone is one of disgust and frustration.

The tone is sarcastic, with the reviewer questioning whether the film's creators intended for it to be humorous, implying that if they did, it's ""pure genius,"" but if not, it's a ""career genocide."" The reviewer describes the audience's reaction, laughing at scenes meant to be serious, suggesting that the film failed to achieve its intended tone.

The reviewer does offer some faint praise, acknowledging that Zane and Brook, the film's stars, are talented and likable, but even this is tempered by the reviewer's overall disdain for the film. The scriptwriter, on the other hand, is singled out for criticism, with the reviewer suggesting they should be ""marooned,"" implying that they are entirely to blame for the film's failures.

The only slightly positive comment is a brief mention of the music, but even that is tempered with the phrase ""not so bad,"" implying that it's not particularly good either.

The reviewer then proceeds to mock the film's plot, describing the characters as ""nice girl and nice boy with perfect bodies and super teeth,"" implying that their physical appearance is the only notable aspect of their characters. The reviewer also ridicules the plot, pointing out absurdities such as the characters finding a plethora of items, including a husband, in the sea.

The reviewer points out inconsistencies in the plot, such as the main character, Miss Brooks, seemingly wearing a white bikini bottom after skinny dipping, and questions the plausibility of Kelly's character always looking clean and polished despite being stranded on a deserted island. The reviewer also criticizes the film's shift towards soft porn and the performances of the actors, particularly Billy Zane. The tone of the review is sarcastic and dismissive, with the reviewer suggesting that the actors should focus on other pursuits, such as photo shoots or more decent scripts.

The reviewer's criticism is not limited to the film's plot and acting but also extends to the characters' behaviors, such as Miss Brooks' reaction to being rescued, which the reviewer finds unrealistic. The review concludes with a tongue-in-cheek suggestion that the actors should pursue other projects, implying that this film is not worth their time or talent.

6066,"If you make a suspense movie it is kind of important that the ""villain"" not be more sympathetic than the ""victim"". And this fails miserably. It was so terrible and frustrating to watch that I was actually moved to register and comment. OK, so the husband is rich and cocky. There are worse vices, and the cabana boy and wife display plenty. The husband is a jerk because he - um, didn't approve of the cabana boy physically assaulting that woman - the witch one which had absolutely nothing to do with the plot BTW. The cabana boy threatens the husband and repeatedly attempts to seduce the wife. He then forces himself on her - which the woman finds so hot she stops thinking rape and starts thinking she wants him. Uh huh. The misogynistic, inferiority complex thoughts the director displays are just revolting. It is one thing when a fine film like American Psycho deliberately tries to get us to empathise with the villain but in Survival Island I felt like I was watching a movie about Ted Bundy but the director failed to make him unlikeable and instead made us hate his victims. What was he thinking???",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is extremely negative, expressing frustration and disgust towards the film ""Survival Island"". The reviewer's primary criticism is that the film's portrayal of the characters is misguided, making the ""villain"" more sympathetic than the ""victim"". The husband, who is depicted as rich and cocky, is shown to be more likable than the cabana boy and the wife, who are portrayed as having worse vices. The reviewer is particularly outraged by the film's handling of a sexual assault scene, where the wife seemingly consents to the cabana boy's advances after being forced upon. This is seen as a misogynistic and revolting portrayal of women.

The reviewer's tone is one of disbelief and anger, questioning the director's intentions and judgment. The comparison to ""American Psycho"" highlights the reviewer's expectation of a more nuanced and deliberate exploration of complex characters, which is lacking in ""Survival Island"". The reviewer's use of strong language, such as ""revolting"" and ""misogynistic"", emphasizes their strong disapproval of the film's themes and characterizations.

And of course what would a movie be without sex. The lady has a nice body and the men are pretty, but the story is the same as Swept Away or A Savage is Loose type with some blood. Wonder if the movie studios know they made a big booboo and already released this show and now gonna release it as THREE. Billy Zane should have worn a top hair piece or shaved his head completely.

They criticize the film's reliance on sex scenes and the lack of originality in the plot.

The reviewer does offer some positive comments, praising Juan Di Pace's performance and a few of the sex scenes.

6068,"What the heck is this about? Kelly (jennifer) seems to drop all moral behavior as soon as she arrives to the island. She finds this Juan P (Manuel) existing and exotic, though she witnessed when he slapped his ex in the face, which he also justify later on in the movie, right or wrong? These two guys are the first to find each other on the island. Kelly are totally lost in every sense and the great Juan P can fish and built a somewhat house. Mr handyman. They seem to have a great time. Then Billy Zane (Jack, Kellys characters husband) shows up and of course, two days without knowing what his wife has been doing whit this gorgeous Juan P, he is a little bit jealous. Billy Z is the stereotype rich guy and maybe not the nicest man in the world. He dislikes Juan P (for hitting his girlfriend at the pier, who can blame him? Hes also is arrogant, but he paid loads of money to rent that boat and Juan P who is the waiter/everything cant even fetch him a beer whit in 20 min. Wouldn't you be upset? Yet Billy is probably the guy you want to punch in the face if you meet him. But at the same time, he is, not to be blamed for, suspicious about the scuba goggles Manuel has. Kelly and Billy just lost some dear friends! How convenient he just happens to have them, no matter what!). However, for some strange reason Kelly likes this girl hitting Manuel and starts to hate Billy for being jealous. OK, Billy is overreacting, thats for sure, but Kelly isn't doing much to convince him either. She spends more time with Juan P and even wants him to sleep with them since hes been so nice (and even though Manuel yelled at her and calling her things for asking him some intimate questions. But Kelly is SO forgiving...). Yeah right. And then she starts to have sex with this Juan P. It should be said that Kelly and Billy seems to have a working relationship before this island incident, at least, they have intimate sex on the boat and talks like people do when they like each other. Now, you can think that this scenario is possible. But for real, is it? Are you cheating your husband after two days on a coconut island just because hes jealous and acts like a drunk in the bar? (i wouldn't disagree if there relationship was really bad but the director doesn't give much hints if thats the case). For Christ sake, Juan P hasn't really shown himself being a good person. Catching some fish and built a wood house to get into someones panties, is that showing a good side? Not trying to befriend Kellys husband in anyway (which would be very simple by letting them be alone most of the island-time, simply be respect) He doesn't care about their relationship (and Kelly cant figure that one out), he just want to have sex with Kelly. Kellys character is just not trustworthy (if she was stranded with Billy and another attractive girl, wouldn't she be upset or what?!). Or maybe she is? Billy Zane plays a not very nice person, and Juan P isn't actually much better if you really think about it. And poor Kelly is so confused, and believes having sex with Juan P will solve everything because her husband is so strange and so aggressive towards poor Juan P? So... for all of you who reads this... What do you think about it? If you where the Kelly character, would you consider cheating on your husband, knowing one day you'll be back in real life, and all of a sudden Billys maybe not that horrible person after all. Hes just too jealous. And if you where Billys character, what do you say, is he totally wrong in his behavior? And Juan P character what do you guys really think of him. One thing is for sure. Manuels exist! Ps... The voodoo thing is so totally wrong here! What the heck was that about?! Seriously!

The reviewer is particularly critical of Kelly's character, played by Jennifer Lopez, who they see as morally bankrupt and lacking in judgment. The reviewer argues that Kelly's decision to cheat on her husband, Billy, with Juan P is unjustified and unrealistic, given the circumstances. They also criticize Juan P's character, played by Manuel, for being manipulative and only interested in sleeping with Kelly.

The reviewer also expresses frustration with the plot, calling it unrealistic and implausible. They question the characters' motivations and actions, particularly Kelly's decision to cheat on her husband and Juan P's lack of effort to befriend Billy. The reviewer also criticizes the film's portrayal of relationships, arguing that it is unrealistic and unhealthy.

The tone of the review is sarcastic and critical, with the reviewer using rhetorical questions to emphasize their points. The reviewer's use of phrases like ""What the heck is this about?"" and ""For Christ sake"" convey their frustration and disbelief at the film's plot and characters.

Really dull! And for the drama: You know it's always a bad sign when you get to dislike all of the characters so much you really don't care who lives and who dies.<br /><br />If you still haven't gotten tired of the reality series Survivor, you may find something to your liking in this movie.

While they acknowledge some redeeming qualities, such as partially good photography and occasional decent directing, these positives are vastly outweighed by the reviewer's scathing criticism of the script and acting. The reviewer's disinterest in the film's romantic scenes and their dislike of the characters further emphasize their negative opinion.

The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and dismissive, with a warning to potential viewers to ""stay well clear"" unless they are fans of reality TV shows like Survivor. This comparison implies that the film is shallow and lacking in substance, appealing only to those with a taste for superficial entertainment. The reviewer's overall assessment is that the film is a waste of time, with few redeeming qualities to speak of.

6070,"""Three"" is a seriously dumb shipwreck movie. Masquerading as a psychological thriller, it's closest relative is the monumentally superior ""Dead Calm"" (also featuring Billy Zane). ""Dead Calm"" provided well drawn characters to root for in the form of Sam Neil and Nicole Kidman's grieving parents attempting to re-define their relationship on an ocean cruise. They end up being terrorised by Zane's adrift psycho-killer. It provided sharp, increasingly ratcheted suspense, a scary feeling of claustrophobia in open seas as the cat and mouse game of life and death unfolded.<br /><br />""Three"" suffers from poorly drawn characterisation (the audience doesn't care what happens to any of them), a stupid and unnecessary voodoo plot device, a total lack of suspense or excitement and some thudding, hammy performances from the principal players. Zane in particular goes way over the top in an irritatingly mannered fashion. In ""Dead Calm"" he was menacing, wired and seething with barely controlled sexual violence. Here he is bombastic, petulant slimy, and unravelled. And where does he get his seemingly inexhaustible supply of dry cigarettes and cigars? And how come his lighter stays full of juice for over a year? Ms Brook is very picturesque, stunningly pretty, but both her chest and rear appear to have been wildly over-inflated by some sort of life-raft pump. They do, however, succeed in acting with more skill and conviction than the rest of her. Dramatic actress, in the purest sense of the term, she is not. The guy playing the voodoo-hexed Manuel, the third component of this sorry triangle, could have been replaced by a lump of driftwood - no one would notice. In fact, judging by his complete lack of ability to deliver dialogue in any meaningful or dynamic way, driftwood represents a potential improvement in the casting stakes (excuse pun).<br /><br />Plus sides: the scenery is nice and the cinematography (above and below the water) is credible.<br /><br />I'm guessing this had a very limited (if any) theatrical release or went straight to rental and retail DVD. The reason for this is it's not very good. If you want something decent along these lines, get ""Dead Calm."" It was made by people who knew a bit about cinema.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing strong disappointment and frustration with the film ""Three"". The reviewer compares it unfavorably to ""Dead Calm"", a similar shipwreck thriller, highlighting the latter's well-developed characters, suspenseful plot, and strong performances. In contrast, ""Three"" is criticized for its poorly drawn characters, a convoluted and unnecessary voodoo plot device, and a lack of suspense or excitement. The reviewer also targets the performances, particularly Billy Zane's over-the-top portrayal, and Kelly Brook's lack of dramatic range. The only positive aspects mentioned are the scenic cinematography and underwater visuals.

The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and dismissive, with a clear disdain for the film's shortcomings. The criticism is not limited to the film's artistic merits but also extends to the actors' performances, with the reviewer questioning the casting choices and implying that even an inanimate object like driftwood could have done a better job. The review concludes by recommending ""Dead Calm"" as a superior alternative, implying that ""Three"" is not worth watching.

The reviewer's use of phrases like ""ha ha"" and ""Good laugh"" suggests that they found the movie's errors entertaining, but not in a good way.

The reviewer's criticism is not limited to the movie's technical issues; they also imply that the film's quality is subpar, giving it a low rating of 1.5 stars and labeling it a ""C-, D+ movie."" The reviewer's tone is lighthearted and humorous, but their criticism is clear: the movie is flawed and not worth watching.

6072,"How much do I love this film?! Now I'm not a fan of bad films, but I do love a film that is so bad it's good. This is one of those. Juan Pablo Di Pace has a great butt, looks fab on screen, and definitely doesn't make a bad turn at his acting debut (I believe). Billy Zane is suitably mean and moody, though I still constantly feel that there is something more in him. I felt it in Titanic, the look on his face when La Winslet spat on him for example, totally broken, shocked, and put-down ... fierce! Kelly Brook is a pretty face ... no seriously, I think that's it! It's worth catching this to see one really hot guy, some big bra fillers from Brook, nasty growling from Billy, laugh at the dialogue, revel in the scenery and madness of the whole affair ...

6073,"By far this has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I watch practically every movie that is on at night (either showtime, hbo, cinemax, etc).

6079,"I'm always interested to see neglected movies that appear to have good credentials, but in this case the film's neglect appears justified. Evidently based on some actual incidents during WWII, the film just doesn't connect with the viewer for some reason that it is not quite clear to me. One very likely reason is that - in the print I saw on TCM, anyway - none of the scenes where the Germans talked among themselves were given titles. This interesting directorial concept - to let the non-German speaking viewer just guess from ""context"" what the Germans are saying to each other - is, in my book, an utter flop and helps to lock the viewer out. Also, the way the movie begins - just dropping us into a very confused situation without much setup - is disorienting. Brian Keith is pretty good here, but the reputations of ""The Great Escape"" and ""Stalag 17"" will not be challenged by this flick.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is largely negative, expressing disappointment and frustration with the film's inability to engage the viewer. The reviewer attributes this disconnection to several factors, including the director's decision not to provide subtitles for scenes where German characters converse among themselves. This choice is seen as a failed experiment, making it difficult for non-German speaking viewers to follow the plot. Additionally, the reviewer criticizes the film's abrupt and confusing opening, which drops the audience into a complex situation without sufficient setup or context. While Brian Keith's performance is acknowledged as a positive aspect, the reviewer ultimately concludes that the film falls short of the standards set by other notable WWII prisoner-of-war movies like ""The Great Escape"" and ""Stalag 17"".

6080,"Great piece of fiction played as if factual. Tonight I was looking at the Birdman of Alcatraz. Robert Stoud was not a model meek prisoner and he was in jail because he was pimping and a customer did not pay up. Once he got into jail he was so uncontrollable he spent most of his time in solitary confinement or in the prison hospital. Killed a few people in prison too. This movie reminds me of the Birdman of Alcatraz but even worse. Robert Stroud did write books and he did contribute to society in someway. And the BOA had some hints of Strouds lunacy. BUT this guy Henry Young who Murder in the First is suppose to be about was a a known bank robber who took hostages and beat them up in more then one robbery. He wasn't some poor guy who stumbled into a grocery store which just happened to be a post office and took some money. This man was a hard core criminal. He also killed a person 3 years before he went to Alcatraz. He killed another person in jail not because of the solitary confinement which ended over a year before the murder. The real story of his life would of been more interesting. They did not even get the warden thing right. You can't be a warden in 3 different prisons at the same time. And by all accounts the warden in the movie was a pretty stand up guy as wardens go. Plus if my math is right the Warden played by Karl Malden in the BOA is suppose to be the same warden in this movie. Oh Boy. Not only that, in this movie we are to think poor Henry committed suicide. And he wrote the word Victory. Not true..he might be alive right now. He was sent to Springfield where Robert Stroud was also a medical center prison then Walla Walla for another murder he committed and then was released and jumped parole in 1972, never to be found. Maybe he is hanging out with that CB Cooper guy who jumped out that airplane in Washington state after committing a bank robbery lol. Now the acting was very good. Kevin Bacon is in that class of actors which include Jeff Bridges and Dennis Quaid, the vastly underrated actors club. Gary oldman well they just might of made-up the warden part so he could play it because he was great. Christian Slater still somehow sounds like Jack Nicholson, I am not sure if that is a good thing or not. Bacons wife Kyra Sedgwick was in the movie I think just because she is his wife. I like her though but not in this flick. For some reason I felt this movie when it first came out was suppose to be a special project for Kevin Bacon. I feel he could of taken a person who is truly a victim of the penal system, there sure is enough of them and spread some light on their plight. Other then picking a psychopath to show as a victim.",Negative,Negative,Negative,negative,"This review is largely negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with the film's inaccuracies and creative liberties taken with the true story of Henry Young. The reviewer is well-versed in the actual events and facts surrounding Young's life, and they point out numerous discrepancies between the film's portrayal and reality. They criticize the film for portraying Young as a sympathetic character, when in reality, he was a hardened criminal with a history of violence. The reviewer also takes issue with the film's depiction of the warden, which they claim is inaccurate and unfair to the real-life warden.

Despite the reviewer's criticisms, they do acknowledge that the acting in the film is good, particularly from Kevin Bacon, Gary Oldman, and Christian Slater. However, they question the inclusion of Kyra Sedgwick, suggesting that she was only cast because of her relationship with Kevin Bacon.

The reviewer's tone is one of disappointment and frustration, as they feel that the film had an opportunity to shed light on the plight of those truly victimized by the penal system, but instead chose to focus on a psychopath. Overall, the review is negative, with the reviewer expressing a sense of wasted potential.

6081,"Let me begin with a personal note as a film and television buff, more on the enjoyment side of life: I love what James Woods can do and has done, and I always love Melanie Griffith, and Natasha Wagner was very good in this awful, miserable, stinking ""true crime"" essay.<br /><br />Whoever really wrote this film apparently never spent any time talking to real criminals with real criminal talents: yes, some thieves are junkies but they have very short careers as thieves. Truly successful thieves are seldom caught because they don't do ""junk"" or any drugs before going on a score ( job ).<br /><br />The James Woods character was true to this paradigm in the beginning of this film, and then the script fell apart completely. He turns into a raging, alcoholic lunatic .... nice work for a high-strung guy like Woods, maybe, but not in the least bit believable.<br /><br />Most criminals are lazy. If they wanted to work they would work.<br /><br />These people in this film are beautiful, self-indulgent, drug-addled narcissistic losers. They couldn't pull off a real score in the real world, the real world where a big and beefy security guard who beats the living hell out of a skinny kid ( as happens in the early scenes of this ""DOG"" ), keeps him beat down and doesn't let him up. Ever.<br /><br />How many ways did I find to hate this film ? Many. Even totally vulgar people -- like most sneak thieves and junkies -- have a larger vocabulary than these cretins. And the 'rip-off' scenes with the neo-Nazi bikers ? Puhlease. All rednecks ain't neo-Nazis and those who are neo-Nazi speed dealers just ain't that dumb !!<br /><br />This film earned a two because Natasha Wagner was extremely good in her role as Rose and because Melanie Griffith still has 'that something special,' or at least she had it for this brutal and offensively stupid film. I'm not one to sing praises of real criminals for any reason, but the reality of these criminal types in this horrible film is that they'd all be dead or in jail by Act 2, Scene 1.

Despite their admiration for the actors, particularly James Woods, Melanie Griffith, and Natasha Wagner, the reviewer's criticism of the film's portrayal of criminals and its overall narrative is scathing.

The reviewer also criticizes the script, calling it ""awful, miserable, [and] stinking,"" and expresses frustration with the film's lack of believability, particularly in its portrayal of the James Woods character.

The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and dismissive, with the reviewer using phrases like ""puhlease"" and ""brutal and offensively stupid film"" to express their disdain. The only redeeming qualities mentioned are the performances of Natasha Wagner and Melanie Griffith, which earn the film a rating of two. However, the reviewer's overall assessment is that the film is a waste of time, even compared to watching a ""lousy Zombie movie.""

6082,"I find myself alarmed that people are not so critical of a work that deserves criticism. The many similarities, both structurally and literally, with 'Amadeus' aside the 'Copying Beethoven' deliberately chooses the easy path by putting audience before art. And therefore denying the world a discerning, intelligent and creative work.<br /><br />Now consider the following: Is it not possible that the real story of the creation of the ninth symphony may actually be an engaging and powerful story itself and equally so in a dramatic telling? Beethoven was completely deaf by the writing of the symphony  isn't that more interesting? How WAS the symphony conducted? Wouldn't it be great to know? So ask yourself, what possible motivation could a filmmaker have for introducing a woman as the copyist? If there was a copyist, he would certainly be a man. What was his story? (please try to be a little critical here even if you like the invention of a woman composer). <br /><br />Fantasy should be much MORE than a distortion of reality to serve a writers purpose. For those who find themselves comparing and justifying the invention of Anna Holtz with the invention of Salieri's claim to have murdered Mozart in 'Amadeus', consider that he confessing to a priest in a lunatic asylum (Schaffer uses this device to great affect in the film). 'Copying Beethoven' may have worked if Anna was a figment of Ludwig's fevered imagination. But we are meant to believe she is 'possible'... Yes and that Strauss was assisted by aliens.<br /><br />Most of the positive reviews I've read here so far are often expressions of a DESIRE for the film to be good; almost a deliberate amnesia. Remembering the film for what you wish it to be rather than what it is.<br /><br />For those who believe that fantasy justifies the means then consider you are not only accepting an inferior interpretation of real events but also sacrificing the truth for the sake of a triviality.<br /><br />Finally, a short note on the acting here that may surprise some of you. Ed Harris is NOT good as Ludwig Van Beethoven. Does that shock you? He looks awkward throughout the film, much like an actor dressed up, but off set and standing at the catering table. Most of his lines are said as cues rather than replies to Anna Holtz's lines (i.e. he is not listening to the actor). He is quite clearly an actor masquerading as the character rather than BEING the character.<br /><br />Really, how many times does Beethoven have to roll in his grave before we get it right? Just ask yourself, would Ludwig approve?",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing strong criticism towards the film ""Copying Beethoven"". The reviewer argues that the film takes the easy path by prioritizing audience appeal over artistic integrity, resulting in a work that lacks creativity and intelligence. The reviewer questions the film's decision to introduce a fictional female copyist, Anna Holtz, instead of exploring the real story of Beethoven's life, which they believe would be more engaging and powerful. The reviewer also criticizes the film's use of fantasy, arguing that it distorts reality to serve the writer's purpose, and that it sacrifices truth for the sake of triviality.

The reviewer also expresses disappointment with Ed Harris's portrayal of Beethoven, stating that he looks awkward and fails to fully embody the character. The reviewer's tone is one of frustration and disappointment, implying that the film has wasted an opportunity to tell a more compelling and accurate story.

6083,"I made a big mistake going to see this film. That's the lottery of going to see films I guess. After five minutes you just knew it was going to be a clunker, and I fought quite hard to stay in my seat - the old ""lose two hours of your life"" kind of feeling.<br /><br />The fundamental problem is that, without even mentioning the whole ""historical accuracy"" thread of reviews, the script is achingly, painful, bad.<br /><br />The first thirty minutes could have been spread out to an hour to give a plausible, real, plot development. Instead, it lurched from from one undramatic ""dramatic"" event to the next. Having the girl cry at the start of the film makes no sense because the audience has no emotional attachment to anything at this point. And that whole walking off into the sunset through the long-grass field at the end, what the hell was that about? <br /><br />Not even the excellent Ed Harris could save this one. You could almost feel his pain at some of the lines he had to utter.

""Wash me"" WTF? That's hilarious.<br /><br />And then there was the music. The long extended session when it was just Beethoven conducting and the 9th Symphony pouring out of the surround sound in the cinema and the choir waiting, waiting, standing there silently for what seems like forever. And then, finally, launching into enormous sound. It was spine-chillingly wonderful and dare I say it, it brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />So that is where the film picked up two stars. The only part of the film where Beethoven got to say exactly what he wanted to say.<br /><br />And I believed him.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing regret for watching the film and struggling to stay seated throughout. The primary criticism is aimed at the script, which is described as ""achingly, painful, bad."" The reviewer argues that the plot development is rushed, and the emotional connections between characters are nonexistent. The dialogue is also ridiculed, with a specific example of a cringe-worthy line (""WASH ME"") that is deemed hilarious due to its absurdity.

The only redeeming aspect of the film, according to the reviewer, is the musical segment featuring Beethoven's 9th Symphony, which is described as ""spine-chillingly wonderful"" and brought tears to their eyes. This brief moment is the sole reason the film earned two stars.

The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and dismissive, implying that the film is a waste of time and that even the talented Ed Harris cannot salvage the poor script. The overall assessment is that the film is a ""clunker"" with a terrible script, poor plot development, and only a single redeeming moment.

6084,"About your terrible movie copying Beethoven. As a professional musician it's my duty to watch every movie made about any composer and Beethoven is one of my favorites. When Hungarians and Americans meet, it's a terrible combination of empty over the top emotions combined with the worst taste possible. You proved it in your terrible b-movie. The only thing that carries the movie is the music. Of course you didn't bother to look further than the good but in my taste contrived performances of the Tackacs quartet, but OK I have to admit that the performances at least have quality as contrast to the movie you've made. It starts of with the dying DEAF Beethoven who perfectly understands Anna who is merely whispering. Beethoven's hearing during the movie get's better by the minute, but that must be because of some vague divine thing. Then there is the quite impossible semi-pornographic ""eyes wide shut"" double-conducting scene which is totally over the top with the luscious Anna and the crying nephew in the end (who also cries in the deleted scenes with constant red eyes, my GOD what a performance). And as culmination the rip-off from Amadeus, with Beethoven dictating music to Anna not in notes but in total nonsense, which she understands perfectly but no-one else in your audience even trained professional musicians will understand. Of course your reaction will be that negative response is a response at least, but I can assure you that Beethoven himself is turning in his grave because of your worthless creation and with reason. This so called homage is blasphemy and I am so sorry to have rented one of the worst movies ever made even though it's about my favorite subject. Ed Harris and others, you cannot comprehend the greatness of Beethoven in your wildest dreams and certainly not after a couple of lessons in conducting and violin playing. That's the trouble with you Americans: you think you can grasp everything even when it takes a lifetime of hard work. Yeah we can do it anyway!

The reviewer also accuses the filmmakers of ripping off scenes from ""Amadeus"" and lacking the talent, devotion, and professionalism required to create a worthy tribute to Beethoven.

The reviewer's tone is confrontational and sarcastic, with personal attacks on the filmmakers, particularly Ed Harris, implying that they are arrogant and lack the necessary expertise to tackle the subject matter.

He shows no credibility at all and overplays Beethoven. Most of all, long hairs doesn't look good at all on his head. The main actress is missing all the subtleties needed for its character. The camera shots are cheesy and too conventional. The lights are to close of the characters feelings. Bad casting and cheap direction. Too bad! The only scene that worth the movie is when Beeth (I hope you don't care that I call him trough his nickname?) is turning the girl's song to a joke.

The reviewer further disparages the film's cinematography, calling the camera shots ""cheesy"" and ""conventional,"" and the lighting, which they believe is too focused on the characters' emotions.

6086,"Yes, I realize that half a dozen other reviewers have called this movie ""Copying Amadeus"", but it cannot be said enough. Scenes seemed to have been lifted directly from Milos Forman's script with only superficial changes. You can expect to see:<br /><br />-The maestro's arrogant scene (""I am the voice of god. Everything else is meaningless!"")<br /><br />-The maestro making fun of the mediocre composer's work (complete with raspberries & simulated flatulence, just like in Amadeus)<br /><br />-The mediocre composer's dialogue with god (""Why do you instill me with music but deny me the ability to compose?"")<br /><br />-The musical dictation from the deathbed scene (""Common time. Begin with the violins... cough cough"")<br /><br />-and the list goes on...<br /><br />The problem is even worse. Not only were these scenes shamelessly copied, they weren't even done very well. Jeepers, if you're going to rip off an original, at least you should try to improve upon it in your own creative way.<br /><br />No wait, there's something even worse than that. It's the fact that the director tried to beat the story of Mozart into the story of Beethoven. Folks, Beethoven was not a crass, vulgar slob the way this movie portrays him. Furthermore, Beethoven was not a babbling idiot who takes pointers from his copyist, a 23 year old music student. Unfortunately, films like this are responsible for butchering history.<br /><br />And another thing, Beethoven (in real life) never called it the ""Moonlight Sonata"" the way he does in the movie. That name was given by a confused critic some years AFTER BEETHOVEN DIED, and unfortunately it stuck. But Beethoven's original title was ""Quasi una Fantasia"".<br /><br />AND ANOTHER THING, when Beethoven (in the movie) yells ""B-flat! B-flat! B-flat!"" and hits the note on the piano, he's hitting a white key!<br /><br />AND ANOTHER THINGGG!!! Beethoven (in real life) was completely deaf for several years before the composition of his 9th Symphony. This movie shows him as having barely a minor disability (saying ""what?"" every other line, just enough to be annoying).<br /><br />AAAND!! ANNNOTHER!!! THINGGGG...!! The American accents...! Oh never mind. Just... never mind. I've wasted enough time on this already. Go see ""Amadeus"" again. Then, if you want to see an interesting biopic on the life of Beethoven see ""Immortal Beloved"" which takes poetic liberties, but at least they're interesting ideas. Lastly, if you want to see something on the lighter side, check out ""Impromptu"", a film about Chopin.

The reviewer lists several specific examples of scenes that were seemingly lifted directly from ""Amadeus"" with only superficial changes, criticizing the film for not even attempting to improve upon the original. The reviewer also takes issue with the film's inaccurate portrayal of Beethoven, citing multiple historical inaccuracies, such as the misrepresentation of his personality, the misuse of musical terminology, and the incorrect depiction of his deafness.

The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and frustrated, with a sense of exasperation and annoyance towards the film's lack of originality and historical accuracy. The review concludes by recommending other films that the reviewer considers superior, implying that the film is not worth watching.

6087,"I expected so much more than what I received from watching this movie. It is not that I object to literary license, (if that is what it should be called) especially when there is no overt attempt to say ""based on a true story."" But this movie is about Beethoven -- a real historical person who is so widely known and so deeply embedded into our musical experiences and I expected the movie to be true to history at least in the primary elements. This movie took such great exception from the historic record it could only disappoint.<br /><br />My assumption (because I had not researched the movie at all) was that it was true. Half way through, I stopped the movie to look it up on IMDb. The rest of the movie was a remarkably different experience. I was relieved that this was not accurate with history because it was so hard to believe a major portion of the story. To enjoy this movie, I was required to recognize it as a fantasy, a ""what if it was like this"" story. The movie lacked this honest disclaimer.<br /><br />What disappointed me most was the fictionalized conducting of the 9th symphony. The very concept portrayed in the film stretched my imagination to the point of incredulity. I ended up doubting anything was true to history other than Ludwig van Beethoven and his relationship with Karl van Beethoven.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the performance of Ed Harris - an exceptional actor who knows how to play a role and keep himself out of it and that was about it and for that I give it a 3/10.<br /><br />Those who portend that this movie is as good as or better than Amadeus have not a clue about either either composers life and are looking only for what this movie really is, for in the end it was a cheap novel of a story - pulp fiction.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing deep disappointment and frustration with the film's creative liberties taken with the life of Ludwig van Beethoven. The reviewer's primary concern is the film's lack of historical accuracy, which they find unacceptable given the subject's importance and widespread recognition. They argue that the film's deviations from the truth are so significant that it becomes a ""what if"" fantasy rather than a biographical drama. The reviewer is particularly upset about the fictionalized depiction of the 9th symphony's premiere, which they find implausible and damaging to the film's credibility.

The reviewer's tone is critical and disapproving, with a sense of betrayal and disillusionment. They imply that the film's failure to provide a disclaimer about its fictionalized content is dishonest and misleading. The only redeeming aspect of the film, in their opinion, is Ed Harris's performance, which they praise as exceptional. However, this is not enough to redeem the film as a whole, and they ultimately give it a low rating of 3/10.

6088,"Awful!<br /><br />Despite the good performance of Ed Harris, Diane Kruger, and the strong budget (the reason for the 3 stars), the movie is by far the worst I saw about a composer, and the worst edition of a masterpiece of music. I agree with some fictional stuff to upgrade a biography, that otherwise couldn't be so ""charming"". This was done in AMADEUS with best results, but this B copy here is a flaw. Beethoven had a strong personality, but was a sensible artist. Here in this movie however, he looks much more as Mike Tyson! I wonder also, whether despite his deafness, he heard all the whisperings in the last scenes (may be a cochlear implant?). I prefer to listen to the ninth on a CD with some nice maestro.

They compare it unfavorably to ""Amadeus,"" another biographical film about a composer, which they consider a masterpiece. The reviewer criticizes the film's portrayal of Beethoven, stating that it is inaccurate and exaggerated, making him seem more like Mike Tyson than the sensitive artist he was. They also question the film's depiction of Beethoven's deafness, finding it implausible.

The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and dismissive, with a sense of disappointment and frustration. They express a strong preference for listening to Beethoven's music on CD, implying that the film does not do justice to the composer's legacy.

6089,"Trite and unoriginal. It's like someone watched Immortal Beloved and Amadeus and decided to mix them together and, in the process, steal other formulaic plot parts from other movies to make another one. As with most historical movies nowadays, there are some inaccuracies as history is manipulated to better suit the story, which is understandable for the most part. For example, during the remaining days of Beethoven's life, it was necessary for other people to write down what they needed to say in order for him to understand them. That, of course, would have been a nuisance to have to show on screen. The script, although filled with some quotable lines, doesn't quite capture the feel of that time period and, coupled with some bad acting, seems rather contemporary. Diane Kruger is nice enough to look at but she still has lots to improve on her craft. Ed Harris doesn't work for me as Beethoven and I mostly blame Gary Oldman for that. Overall, not a very good interpretation of the musical maestro's life.

The reviewer also points out historical inaccuracies, which, although understandable, detract from the film's authenticity. The script is criticized for not capturing the feel of the time period, and the acting, particularly by Diane Kruger, is seen as subpar. Ed Harris's portrayal of Beethoven is also panned, with the reviewer suggesting that Gary Oldman's iconic performance in ""Immortal Beloved"" sets a high standard that Harris fails to meet.

The reviewer's tone is dismissive and disapproving, implying that the film is a poor interpretation of Beethoven's life.

6090,"I am a music lover and was excited to see this movie. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I was ready to walk out half way through the movie. I didn't identify with any of the characters, which meant that I didn't care what happened to them and lost interest in the story completely. On the good side, Ed Harris looked exactly like Beethoven, and the 9th Symphony is always a pleasure to hear, so that made part of the film bearable. Also the parts where they talk about the bridge almost redeemed the entire movie, but it couldn't sustain me through to the end. The actors did what they could with what they had to work with, but the screenplay just wasn't adequate to make it even remotely interesting. The bit about ""wash me"" was utter rubbish.

The reviewer, a self-proclaimed music lover, was initially excited to see the movie but was quickly let down. The main issue lies in the reviewer's inability to connect with the characters, which led to a complete loss of interest in the story. The reviewer criticizes the screenplay, stating that it was inadequate and failed to make the film remotely interesting.

Although the reviewer does mention a few positive aspects, such as Ed Harris's resemblance to Beethoven and the pleasure of hearing the 9th Symphony, these are not enough to redeem the film in their eyes. The reviewer also mentions a few specific scenes that they found enjoyable, such as the discussion about the bridge, but these moments were not enough to sustain their interest throughout the film.

The reviewer's tone is one of disappointment and frustration, with a hint of sarcasm when discussing the ""wash me"" scene, which they found ridiculous. The overall sentiment is that the film had potential but was ultimately let down by a poor screenplay.

Throughout the movie Beethoven is shown to be hard of hearing but quite capable of understanding people who speak loudly. In reality, Beethoven had lost much of his hearing seven years earlier (1817). Beethoven never experienced permanent deafness; his condition fluctuated between total silence and terrible tinnitus. The Ninth Symphony was composed at a time when Beethoven's hearing had deteriorated severely. At this point in his life, most of Beethoven's conversations were facilitated by the use of notebooks. It can be argued, however, that he was also able to read people's lips, evidenced by his insistence that people face him when they spoke to him.<br /><br />In the film, Beethoven makes an allusion to the Moonlight Sonata.

6093,"Am I the only person who saw and remembers Amadeus. Every scene in ""Copying"" has its counterpart in the Milos Forman, Amadeus - from the galloping carriages accompanied by frenzied strings, to the entrance of Anna through the dark hallway preceded by the man with the key, to the very dialog of the conclusion with Anna at Beethoven's feet a la Salieri before the dying Mozart. Does no one else recall the dialog in that script: <br /><br />Salieri ""Time?"" , Mozart ""Common time"". .....""We begin with the strings..."" and so it ""copies"".<br /><br />Remember Cynthia Nixon leaning against a door jamb, tears falling down her freckled face - same scene, just replace her with Beethoven's nephew. Even the scatological humor (fart jokes) are the same. We even have a cardinal followed around by a plate of sweet cookies which recalls Salieri in the banquet hall. Does no one else remember? !!!!<br /><br />And the scene where Anna cries to God ""Why did you give me this gift?""...

The reviewer's primary criticism is that the film appears to be heavily inspired by, or even copying, scenes and dialogue from the film ""Amadeus"", directed by Milos Forman. The reviewer lists several specific examples of similarities between the two films, including identical scenes, dialogue, and even character mannerisms. This perceived lack of originality is seen as a major flaw in the film.

The reviewer also criticizes the script as ""juvenile"" and the exposition as childish, implying that the film's storytelling is immature and unsophisticated. The reviewer questions the purpose of certain characters and plot elements, such as the bridge builder, suggesting that they serve no meaningful purpose in the narrative.

The only positive comment made is about a single scene, where the music and the interaction between Anna and Beethoven are described as intense and erotic. However, this is not enough to redeem the rest of the film, which the reviewer sees as unoriginal and lacking in depth.

6094,"According to ""Lucien Rebatet"" in his ""Histoire de la Musique"" (Robert Lafont, BOUQUINS 1973 page 338) Beethoven's character was not very compatible with women. He had quite a number of ""Platonic Passions"" with female members of the ""Vienese Aristocracy"" to whom he dedicated some ""sonatas"". But Musicians , even composers did not qualify for Husbands of ""Fine Ladies"". Haydn was a ""servant"" of Prinz Von Esterhazy, Mozart died from drink or Poison and Bethoven was according to Rebatet a frequent customer of ""street prostitutes"" in Vienna. A British biographer, Newman says that Beethoven contracted syphilis, before he was 40. That he became deaf because of that, is possible, but not certain.<br /><br />The Ninth Symphony was premiered on May 7, 1824 in the Kärntnertortheater in Vienna, along with the Consecration of the House Overture and the first three parts of the Missa Solemnis.

The reviewer suggests that the film's depiction of Beethoven's relationships is overly idealized and does not accurately reflect his true nature.

The reviewer praises Ed Harris's performance as Beethoven, but criticizes the film's linear and simplistic portrayal of the composer's life, which is based on a 1823 painting by Ferninand Waldmüller.

The presence of notable actors such as Rod Steiger, Joe Mantegna, and Jennifer Beals is not enough to salvage the film, which is seen as a shameless attempt to capitalize on the original's title and reputation.

The reviewer's tone is one of disappointment and frustration, with a hint of incredulity that Rod Steiger, an actor known for his quality work, would participate in such a project. The implication is that Steiger may have been motivated by financial necessity rather than artistic merit.

The movie's most interesting idea is of the war between Zeus and Hera as being a war between the male and female, but the movie drops the ball on this, making Hera's followers fairly horrible while not being clear on what Zeus' followers do or believe. The movie is also interesting because you don't see the gods and there's no real certainty that they exist.

The reviewer also expresses strong dissatisfaction with the film's visual effects, specifically the CGI, which they deem ""terrible."" They single out the poor design of the hart and the inconsistent skin tone of Leelee Sobieski's character as examples of the film's subpar production quality. However, the reviewer's most scathing criticism is reserved for the film's handling of the twelve labors of Hercules, which they claim is reduced to only five labors, with the final one not even being completed. This perceived laziness and lack of attention to detail is seen as a major flaw in the film.

The reviewer is particularly upset that the film, intended for an older audience, is just as inaccurate as the Disney version, which was aimed at children.

The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and dismissive, implying that the film's attempts at maturity, including the inclusion of sex, violence, and nudity, are wasted on a poorly executed story.

6102,"This is easily the worst adaptation of Greek mythology I've ever seen. It utterly fails as an adaptation of the original myth, inventing silly plot twists and reducing the 12 labours to... 3 or 4, I think. It makes up utterly needless things to try to integrate other myths in clumsy ways which bring into question the writers' having ever read the myths, like changing birds to harpies, lions to sphinxes, the Oracle of Delphi to Tiresias, and bulls to a pedantic version of Proteus, even integrating aspects, never seen outside of Sam Raimi's entertaining series, concerning his first marriage, to a woman with the co-opted name of one of the Furies so it sounds appropriate to the period.<br /><br />I could accept much of that, but it also fails completely in pure film standards; most painful is the dialogue, leaden, portentous pseudo-Shakespearean tripe. It is a poor re-interpretation of the myths, making a sad attempt at the kind of post-modern revisionism that Crichton's ""The 13th Warrior"" attempted in regards to the Beowulf legend, while still including the strictly mythological elements such as clear interference from the gods and magical super-strength.

The reviewer's tone is scathing, with phrases like ""sad, sad failure of an entertainment experience"" and ""utterly fails as an adaptation of the original myth"" emphasizing their strong disapproval. The comparison to ""The 13th Warrior"" suggests that the reviewer has seen better attempts at reinterpreting mythological stories, making this film's shortcomings even more glaring.

6103,"I survived the first hour of this and came back for the last ten minutes, just to say I saw the end. If you want *real* mythology, flawlessly executed, look for Armand Assante's ""The Odyssey."" Great storytelling doesn't need to be tweaked - the stories are fantastic on their own. I only hope Sean Astin needed the money. And Sophocles and Ovid must be whirling in their graves - wherever those may be.<br /><br />At least with Sorbo's version, the tongue was poked relentlessly in cheek - we knew it was mostly balderdash, but perhaps enough interest was generated in the backstory to send someone to the library.I'm surprised Halmi could turn out something so amusing (the TV series), and follow it with something so devoid of quality.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, expressing disappointment and frustration with the film's adaptation of mythology. The reviewer barely made it through the first hour and only returned to watch the final ten minutes, implying that the film was not engaging or enjoyable. The reviewer criticizes the film's execution, suggesting that the original myths are fantastic on their own and do not need to be altered. The mention of Armand Assante's ""The Odyssey"" serves as a positive counterexample, implying that this film got it right.

The reviewer also expresses disappointment in Sean Astin's involvement, implying that he must have needed the money to participate in such a poor production. The mention of Sophocles and Ovid ""whirling in their graves"" is a hyperbolic expression of the reviewer's disgust and disrespect for the film's handling of mythology. The comparison to Sorbo's version, which is described as ""balderdash"" but at least self-aware and playful, further emphasizes the reviewer's disappointment with this film.

The final sentence, which mentions the producer's previous work on a TV series, implies that the reviewer had some expectations that were not met, making the failure of this film even more disappointing.

6104,"Paul Telfer, who plays Hercules in this TV film, has to be the hottest thing on two legs EVER. Wow.<br /><br />But this film is a 100% distortion of the Hercules story. Just like ""Troy,"" this film has nothing to do with the original story. Zero. What makes it especially insulting is that they actually contrived a gay character just so people could hate him, making him as dastardly and evil as any character in the history of TV or cinema. This is triply insulting since Hercules may have had a wife, since that was the expectation of those olden days, but he also had at least a dozen male lovers. So it is ironic that they should create a gay royal adversary character for this film. No, not ironic. Evil. The creators of this travesty should hang their heads in shame.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is a mixed bag, with the reviewer expressing admiration for the lead actor, Paul Telfer, but vehemently criticizing the film's handling of the Hercules story and its portrayal of a gay character. The reviewer is enthusiastic about Telfer's physical appearance, calling him the ""hottest thing on two legs EVER."" However, this positive sentiment is short-lived, as the reviewer launches into a scathing critique of the film's creative liberties with the Hercules myth.

The reviewer accuses the filmmakers of distorting the original story, making it unrecognizable, and creating a gay character solely to be hated. The reviewer finds this portrayal not only inaccurate but also offensive, given the historical context of Hercules' relationships. The reviewer's tone is one of outrage and indignation, with strong language used to condemn the filmmakers.

Given the reviewer's strong negative reaction to the film's content and themes, the overall sentiment of the review is overwhelmingly negative.

6105,"""Embarassing"" is the only word to describe this laughingly awful production. From the blatant disregard of the source material (sure to infuriate anyone remotely familiar with mythology) to the predictably insufficient production value, this entire mini-series is a train wreck.<br /><br />The cast (which includes some good actors, whom I pity) delivers the illogical dialogue in the same generic ""European"" accent so common to bad epics. Worse is the lack of originality in almost all other aspects, from costume and set design (blurring together styles from across time and space) to the score (which seems to poorly mimic many recognizable classical tunes as well as ""Lord of the Rings""). Most offensive of all are the visual effects, which single- handedly prove that if you can't afford to do them well, WRITE THEM OUT.<br /><br />It pained me to see yet another legendary tale bastardized by a cheap ""adaptation."" Maybe one day, someone will do it right.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is a scathing critique of the mini-series, with the reviewer expressing utter disdain for the production. The reviewer's use of strong language, such as ""laughingly awful"" and ""train wreck,"" sets the tone for a blistering assessment of the series. The reviewer takes issue with the production's disregard for the source material, citing inaccuracies that would offend anyone familiar with mythology. The cast, which includes some talented actors, is not spared from criticism, as the reviewer mocks their delivery of ""illogical dialogue"" in a generic accent.

The reviewer's criticism extends to various aspects of the production, including the costume and set design, which are deemed unoriginal and lacking in cohesion. The score is also panned for its unoriginality and resemblance to other, better-known works. The visual effects are singled out as particularly egregious, with the reviewer suggesting that they should have been omitted altogether if they couldn't be done well.

6106,"I hadn't heard anything about this project until I saw that it was going to be on, so I watched it with a completely open mind. And, gee, the cast is full of strong players.<br /><br />Unfortunately . . . it's awful. I don't mean it isn't good; I mean it's extraordinarily bad -- sometimes laughably so, but mostly it's just boring. Its strongest appeal comes from having attractive people as naked as US network TV will allow, but it's all tease and no substance, and having nymphs as backup characters can't justify several hours of bad TV.<br /><br />There are two basic problems that the cast can't overcome. First, the script is *awful*. Yes, making changes to the Hercules myth (which is certainly not a single monolithic story in the first place) is traditional, but this version is relentlessly dull and much too frequently dumb (and sometimes downright head-shakingly peculiar), with terrible pacing, bits borrowed from here and there (and several parts seemingly belonging in different films), and truly awful dialogue. The dialogue is frequently unbearably bad, in fact, to the point where you feel embarrassed for the actors. Sean Astin, apparently now typecast as second-banana, seems especially burdened by one awful line after another. There's no consistency of tone or atmosphere and little cohesion to the plot.<br /><br />Second, most of the special effects are really bad. REALLY bad. There's occasionally a decent bit of CGI, but mostly, again, you feel really embarrassed on behalf of the cast. I have no idea what the budget for this project was, but it sure looks like crap compared to ""Clash of the Titans"" or even ""Hercules: The Legendary Journeys"" and doesn't even compare very favorably with the old Lou Ferrigno and Italian 'spaghetti' Hercules movies. Just painfully miserable.<br /><br />There are plenty of other problems -- the story is needlessly complex and can't keep up with itself, and Hercules himself isn't presented as a very interesting character. Almost everyone who doesn't have a European accent tries to fake one of some kind, which is not merely amateurish and dated but never really made sense in the first place: drama doesn't become better just because the actors use British accents, after all. But the terrible script and equally terrible effects sink the whole thing right off the bat.<br /><br />In fairness, ""Hercules"" was apparently intended as a four-hour miniseries but truncated (for this airing, anyway) to a three-hour TV movie. I don't know what they cut, but it's possible the edits made things worse. I don't think you could make ""Hercules"" good by adding to it, but that doesn't mean that the continuity, say, hasn't suffered from the network edits. There's no way I'll watch the USA version to see, though.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with the TV movie ""Hercules"". The reviewer starts by mentioning that they had an open mind when watching the film, but were ultimately let down by its poor quality. The cast, which includes strong players, is unable to overcome the film's two major flaws: a terrible script and bad special effects. The script is criticized for being dull, dumb, and inconsistent, with terrible pacing, dialogue, and plot cohesion. The special effects are also panned, with the reviewer feeling embarrassed for the cast.

The reviewer also mentions other problems with the film, including a needlessly complex story, a poorly presented main character, and amateurish attempts at accents. The reviewer suggests that the film's truncation from a four-hour miniseries to a three-hour TV movie may have contributed to its problems, but ultimately concludes that the film is beyond redemption.

The tone of the review is scathing, with the reviewer using strong language to express their dislike of the film, calling it ""awful"", ""laughably bad"", and ""painfully miserable"". The reviewer's criticism is not limited to the film's technical aspects, but also extends to its artistic and creative decisions.

6110,"Hercules: The TV- Movie Hercules - A very twisted and molted version of the story about the Greek superhero. Paul Telfer makes a good attempt to play this hero.

I almost expected his to say at one point ""We're in a bad situation Mr. Frodo, uh I mean Hercules.

Unfourtunetly someone has twisted and molted the original story into somewhat of a murky and sometimes incomprehensible story. The special effects don't help either. While the Hydra scene does the original story justice, the Nemean Lion and Harpies are just....well lame. I believe the creatures and effects from Power Rangers flashed across my mind at least twice. And the Golden Hind felt rushed and very computer generated. And they took out Cerberus! One of my favorite parts of what was originally a very cool story.

Some low budget TV movies have actors that at least look enthusiastic. The actors in WEBS look like they were getting paid minimum wage and were working on a Time-Clock. They have that desperate, ""The-Paycheck-Better-Not-Bounce"" look. The Queen Spider looks great, except it is rarely seen, and there are no other spiders (and no webs). The Queen Spider bites people, and they become Spider Zombies, which means that they try to keep their eyes WIDE OPEN when they are attacking the humans.

How did they do this? If this parallel Earth was the same as ours where the hell was the army? The police? All of our weapons? A few fragile looking spider things against literally billions of humans?! The whole flawed, stupid & downright naff concept constantly bugged me throughout the entire film. Lets not forget that there is a inter-dimensional portal to a parallel Earth in the basement of most buildings that have sat there undisturbed for decades & remain in perfect working order, right? Then there's the nuclear reactor the size of a briefcase, the fact one electrician can make it work perfectly purely by accident as he randomly presses a few buttons in a room that probably had 100's spread over dozens of pieces of equipment & what about the wonderfully thoughtful guy who sets an explosive bobby trap in his base without telling anyone, what if one of his mates had set it off & found themselves blown to pieces by their mates homemade bomb?

The only half decent thing I can say about Webs is that it's short & it moves along at a fair pace but when all said & done it's still crap.<br /><br />Director Wu has to take a large chunck of the blame here, for a start the film looks cheap & the editing that he is credited with is terrible. There's lots of annoying inappropriate slow motion shots that come from nowhere, the action scenes are almost identical & become incredibly boring very quickly. He uses that highly annoying quick cut technique along with a bit of the old jerky camera movement, now I don't know about anyone else but I hate this editing style as it just looks a complete incoherent mess. In fact I don't know a single person who does like this sort of thing & I'm puzzled as to why filmmakers think people do. Forget about any gore, just a few shotgun wounds to the spider zombie soldier guys & they don't have red blood anyway so it doesn't relate to reality in my mind.<br /><br />Webs was made-for-TV, the American Sci-Fi Channel I think & it looks every bit as cheap, low budget & rushed as you would expect. It's all so bland, forgettable, flat & dull. The special effects are far from special & the spider thing lacks imagination when finally revealed. The acting was OK considering everything else was so poor & I still can't believe the sweater Grieco was wearing in this.<br /><br />Webs is crap, I can't really say anything good about it other than I've sat through worse films & that's the sole reason I'm not giving it 1 star & a quick glance at the IMDb user ratings for Webs confirms what I already knew in that it has more '1' votes than any other & there is very good reason why...",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing strong dissatisfaction with almost every aspect of the film ""Webs"". The reviewer criticizes the script, calling it ""preposterous"" and pointing out numerous plot holes, inconsistencies, and implausible scenarios. They also question the film's logic, such as the idea that a few mutant spider creatures could take over an entire parallel Earth. The reviewer is frustrated by the film's lack of coherence, poor editing, and cheap production values.

The reviewer also targets the director, David Wu, for the film's technical shortcomings, including poor editing, annoying slow-motion shots, and a jerky camera style. They express disappointment with the lack of gore and the unimpressive special effects. The acting is described as ""OK"" but not enough to redeem the film's numerous flaws. The reviewer concludes that ""Webs"" is a ""crap"" film, with few redeeming qualities, and that it's only slightly better than the worst films they've seen.

6119,"WEBS is a pretty odd movie, albeit slightly watchable. Richard Grieco plays an electrician who gets suck into a parallel Earth overrun by mutant spiders, or something like that. The film itself was made with a modest budget, which explains the limited locales, and the somewhat tedious screenplay that manages to do very little with quite an interesting premise. Basically a 90 minute episode of the TV show ""Sliders"", and nothing more.<br /><br />4 out of 10<br /><br />(go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review and reviews of other films in the genre)",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review of the movie WEBS is generally negative, with the reviewer describing it as ""odd"" and ""slightly watchable"". The reviewer criticizes the film's limited budget, which they believe resulted in a lack of creativity in terms of setting and a tedious screenplay that fails to fully explore the interesting premise of a parallel Earth overrun by mutant spiders. The reviewer also compares the film unfavorably to an episode of the TV show ""Sliders"", implying that the movie lacks originality and depth.

The reviewer's tone is somewhat dismissive, and their rating of 4 out of 10 reinforces the negative assessment. While they do acknowledge that the premise is interesting, they seem to be disappointed that the film fails to live up to its potential. The review is brief and to the point, with the reviewer not finding much to praise about the movie.

6120,"There can be no worse criticism for a movie than the word BORING.<br /><br />Some ""bad"" movies are lots of fun, some ""fun"" movies are really bad, but to be BORING means no-one will ever buy the DVD to watch it over and over again.<br /><br />It appeared to be a movie that employed the drama class from the Antartic, they were all too busy running around to stay warm instead of acting.

The reviewer's sarcastic tone is evident in their description of the actors, likening them to a ""drama class from Antarctica"" and criticizing the lead actor's whispery voice, implying that it's more annoying than seductive.

The reviewer's language is harsh, with phrases like ""I hope this one dies a swift, never to be seen again, death,"" indicating a strong desire for the film to fail and be forgotten. The reviewer's overall assessment is that the movie is a complete waste of time, and its lack of entertainment value will prevent it from being successful.

6121,"Friz Freleng's 'Snafuperman' is one of the lesser Private Snafu shorts. A warning of the importance of studying your field manual, 'Snafuperman' makes it point rather clumsily. The story, in which Technical Fairy, First Class makes Snafu into a superhuman in order to help him see the error of his ways, is predictable and unfunny. Freleng's earlier Snafu short 'Rumours' had been bursting with ideas and laughs but here the director is lumbered with a rather boring topic and he struggles to make an entertaining short from it. Even at around three minutes long, 'Snafuperman' seems to drag and, unlike the best cartoons in the series, it feels like an instructional film first and entertainment second. Though they were knocked out more quickly than the usual Warner cartoons, the Snafu shorts largely maintained a surprisingly high standard. 'Snafuperman' is a reflection of the sort of quality you'd more reasonably expect from a less talent bunch of creative minds.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review of the Private Snafu short ""Snafuperman"" is largely negative, criticizing the film's predictability, lack of humor, and clumsy storytelling. The reviewer compares it unfavorably to another Snafu short, ""Rumours"", which they found to be bursting with ideas and laughs. The reviewer suggests that the topic of the importance of studying one's field manual is dull and that Friz Freleng, the director, struggled to make an entertaining short from it. The review also notes that the short feels like an instructional film first and entertainment second, which is not typical of the Snafu series.

The reviewer's tone is dismissive, implying that ""Snafuperman"" is a subpar effort from a talented team, and that it's the kind of quality one would expect from a less talented group of creatives. The reviewer's criticism is not limited to the story, but also extends to the pacing, stating that even at a short three minutes, the film feels like it drags.

6122,"This good-guy-vs-the-evil-tyrant story, set in 19th century Russia, may have been an attempt to extend Steve Reeves' career beyond those ""Hercules"" movies. However, despite the different costumes, it's still a ""Hercules"" movie with the usual stilted dialog, haphazard dubbing, and cardboard characters. On the other hand, there's lots of action, the pace rarely flags, and Reeves gets to do yet another one of those scenes where he's stripped to the waist, bound with ropes, and given a vigorous whipping which, needless to say, has little effect on his defiant character.",Negative,Negative,Mixed,positive,"This review is mixed, but ultimately leans towards a negative assessment of the film. The reviewer acknowledges that the film has some positive aspects, such as its fast-paced action and Steve Reeves' physical presence, which is showcased in a familiar scene where he is stripped, bound, and whipped. However, these positives are outweighed by the reviewer's criticisms of the film's poor dialogue, haphazard dubbing, and one-dimensional characters. The reviewer also implies that the film is overly formulaic and lacks originality, comparing it unfavorably to Reeves' earlier ""Hercules"" movies.

The reviewer's tone is somewhat sarcastic and dismissive, suggesting that the film is not a serious or substantial work. The comparison to the ""Hercules"" movies is not meant as a compliment, implying that the film is simply a rehashing of familiar tropes and ideas. Overall, while the reviewer acknowledges some minor pleasures, the review is more negative than positive.

6123,"The White Warrior is definitely one of,if not Steve Reeves weakest films. Set in 18th or 19th century Russia (??) Steve plays a cossack warrior who tries to over run a mad man Russian czar by running up a mountain side with his rebel band in a goofy looking Russian white tunic..... For the most part the great Reeves physique is hidden in a goofy, knee length tunic, with an even more sillier looking russian hat.<br /><br />The action is rather minimal, with only a good wrestling scene from the mid waist up that shows off the great Reeves physique. This is an apparent attempt by the producers to move Reeves out of the sword and sandal genre into another historic era, with poor results. The dialogue from the script is hard to understand at various points, and only commentary from the narrator allows the viewer to understand what is really happening from scene to scene. I would image Reeves regretted making this film, but in an attempt to try and get out of his toga and sandals and tribune armor it helped launch him to other historic characters such as Morgan the Pirate and the Thief of Baghdad.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is largely negative, criticizing Steve Reeves' film ""The White Warrior"" as one of his weakest efforts. The reviewer expresses disappointment with the film's poor production quality, citing the protagonist's unflattering costume, which hides Reeves' physique, and the minimal action scenes. The dialogue is also criticized for being hard to understand, requiring narration to clarify the plot. The reviewer implies that the film's attempt to transition Reeves from the sword and sandal genre to a new historical era was unsuccessful.

The only positive aspect mentioned is a single wrestling scene that showcases Reeves' physique. However, this is not enough to redeem the film's overall shortcomings. The reviewer speculates that Reeves might have regretted making this film, but notes that it did lead to other roles in historic characters.

6124,"Reeves plays Haji Murad, a hero in 1850's Russia.<br /><br />This is a badly dubbed movie, with June Foray doing some of the voices.

Anyone who says that Japanese films are bad have never watched this film.<br /><br />The film's plot is instantly forgettable and so I've forgotten it in the time its taken the movie to end and for me to sit and write this down. Perhaps it has more to do with the fact that the film is one of the many that Reeves made in hopes of moving away from action to more plot driven sort of films. It may have been a good thing for Reeves, but its deadly for the audience who have to slug through nooze fests such as this, where its all court intrigue with very little action.<br /><br />In Reeves defense, he was a good actor, he just had no real luck in picking films that were any good.

The primary criticisms are directed towards the poor dubbing, with the voices not matching the lip movements, making it difficult to follow. The reviewer also dismisses the plot as ""instantly forgettable,"" implying that it lacks any memorable or engaging elements. Furthermore, the reviewer criticizes the film's pacing, labeling it a ""nooze fest"" that fails to deliver any excitement or action.

The reviewer does offer some defense for the actor, Keanu Reeves, suggesting that he was a good actor who unfortunately made poor film choices. However, this does not redeem the film in the reviewer's eyes, as they conclude that it is a sleep-inducing experience, only suitable for those struggling with insomnia.

They also make sarcastic comments, such as comparing the cast to ""grown Neanderthals,"" and mocking the film's technical aspects, like the ""low budget fireworks."" The only faint praise offered is that the film is ""watchable"" as an early example of a particular genre or style, but the reviewer quickly qualifies this by stating that there's no reason to revisit the film.

The postscript, which mentions that ""the guys are quite alright,"" seems out of place amidst the otherwise scathing criticism, but it does little to mitigate the overall negative tone of the review.

6126,"This has some of the stupidest fight scenes of all time. If I was a veteran of any war I would cry when I see this movie, not because I would remember being in Vietnam, but because it is a poor representation of any veteran of that war. Even though the troops are carrying M16s, that movie resembles nothing like Vietnam. The Viet Cong even uniforms look like old leftover Japanese uniforms from a WWII movie. The setting is obviously some crappy Hollywood back lot. The worst scene contains a US soldier fighting ""hand to hand"" like in a bad martial arts movie. After he dispatches several enemy troops he says, ""hey come down here and lets kick some butt!"" to a helicopter in the air. He then is shot.

The reviewer expresses disappointment with the acting, stating that it deteriorates as the movie progresses.

6129,"I don't think this movie had the effect on me that was intended: seeing American soldiers shooting wounded soldiers from the other side, and punching wounded prisoners in their wounds to torture them into making them talk made me root for the other side.

6131,"I also have been a wife of an abusive husband, even if in my situation the attacks were psychological, not physical. He presented a very respectable, responsible and generous personality to anyone who saw us together, which, in contrast to myself, resulted in having others treat me as dull and unstable. Initially, I was so incredibly flattered that anybody like Gus (who worked in a bank and was handsomely confident) would even give me the time of day, and I fell completely head-over-heels for the IDEA of him, rather than the person he was. If I'd had my head on straight, and gotten to know him much better first, there's no way I'd have married him. However, that's my mistake. It wasn't my mistake to be abused. I didn't deserve that, nor did I see it coming until I was embroiled in the mind games, criticism and isolation. He acted like I had no business holding an opinion that differed from his own - actually he went further. If I didn't agree, he assumed I misunderstood, and increasingly simplified his wording ... by the time I finally lost my self-respect, I was incapable of recognizing the predicament I was in, and I had to be jolted to reality by outside influence. My dad said Gus called me a bitch. Well ... it was still a half-year before the rage that began at that moment finally exploded and I packed some stuff while he was at work, and I left. .. and it was still another several months before I could grasp the fact that I had been abused, and that it wasn't my fault he was doing the things he did. ..... so please, anyone who assumes it's the fault of the victim, THINK!!! If a puppy is kicked by a cruel owner when, in an anxious situation it has an accident on the rug, do you blame the puppy? by the time the abuse in a relationship reaches an obvious violent level, the target of abuse has been so wounded and depersonalized (much like in Nazi concentration camps) that it's nearly impossible to judge the circumstance accurately, because by then, the victim believes all the horrible things spewed by the abuser. Have a heart, people. Labelling abuse victims as stupid morons is like kicking someone who's already terribly beaten. -------> and this helps how???",Negative,Negative,negative,positive,"This review is not a traditional film review, but rather a personal and emotional response to a movie that resonates with the author's own experiences of being in an abusive relationship. The author shares their personal story of being in a psychologically abusive marriage, where their partner presented a respectable facade to the outside world while manipulating and controlling them behind closed doors. The author reflects on how they were initially blinded by their partner's charm and confidence, only to later realize the abuse they were suffering.

The review is not a critique of the film's cinematography, plot, or acting, but rather a heartfelt and passionate plea for empathy and understanding towards victims of abuse. The author implores readers to recognize that abuse is never the victim's fault and that blaming the victim only exacerbates the trauma. The author's use of a powerful analogy, comparing abuse victims to a kicked puppy, drives home the point that victims are not to blame for their circumstances.

The review is a powerful and emotional call to action, urging readers to have compassion and understanding for those who have suffered abuse. While it does not provide a traditional film review, it is a testament to the impact that a film can have on someone's life and a reminder of the importance of empathy and understanding.

6134,"Since the characters begin with ""Unknown"" identities, they not identified by name, so you start with handsome James Caviezel waking up in a warehouse.

Four other awakening men make it a quintet - Mr. Caviezel in his ""Jean Jacket"", Barry Pepper in a ""Ranger Shirt"", Greg Kinnear with a ""Broken Nose"", Joe Pantoliano as a chair ""Bound Man"", and Jeremy Sisto shot and ""Handcuffed Man"".

While the reviewer acknowledges the potential of the premise, they express disappointment with the execution, stating that the story ""reads a lot better than it looks on film."" The main criticism is that the characters are underdeveloped, making it difficult for the audience to become invested in their fate.

6136,"The promotions for ""Clubbed"" project a slick looking film based around the clubbing scene of the 1980's. What we end up with is a film with identity issues.

The reviewer expresses disappointment and frustration with the film's inability to stay on track, instead meandering through various themes such as boxing, depression, and gangsters, which are hastily crammed into a short runtime. The club scenes, which are supposedly the main attraction, are described as bland and repetitive, featuring only a handful of extras in a barely recognizable club setting.

The reviewer's tone is one of disappointment and disillusionment, implying that the film's promotional materials misled viewers about the film's content. The comparison to ""Human Traffic,"" a film that successfully captured the essence of the late 1990s club scene, serves to further emphasize ""Clubbed""'s shortcomings. Overall, the review suggests that viewers looking for a film that authentically portrays the 1980s club scene should look elsewhere.

6137,"This movie was an absolute waste of time. It's nothing but a wanna-be gangster movie. It contains a very predictable plot. My feelings are unsympathetic to the characters, and the dialogue is mediocre at best. Half the time you are looking for something else to do, because the movie is that boring, since you already know what's going to happen. The other half of the time you're desperately hoping the protagonist grows a pair of balls or just ends his life by jumping off a bridge or something. Also, the secondary characters are for the most part one- dimensional. There's no depth to any of the characters in this movie! No depth!",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is extremely negative, with the reviewer expressing strong dissatisfaction with the film. The reviewer's criticism is multifaceted, targeting the plot, characters, and dialogue. The plot is deemed predictable, making the viewing experience dull and unengaging. The reviewer shows no emotional investment in the characters, finding them one-dimensional and lacking depth. The dialogue is also panned as mediocre, further contributing to the reviewer's overall disappointment.

The reviewer's tone is scathing, with phrases like ""absolute waste of time"" and ""desperately hoping the protagonist grows a pair of balls"" conveying a strong sense of frustration and annoyance. The reviewer's suggestion that the protagonist might as well end their life is a hyperbolic expression of their disinterest in the character's fate.

6138,"""Clubbed"" is yet another 'will-this-do?' entry into the Brit fisticuffs genre and is sure to keep punters who aren't expecting too much moderately entertained for ninety minutes after a few beers. However, for anyone seeking intelligent, quality entertainment it's really best avoided.<br /><br />There are so many misnomers in the appalling script that even an actor of the calibre of Colin Salmon is left looking daft. The action is set in the 1980s, but it's never clear why, especially when they haven't been able to pull off any convincing feel for that decade - it takes more than a few 80s soul records on the soundtrack, the occasional zoot suit and a handful of 30-year-old cars. Then we see central characters studying texts such as Sun Tzu's ""The Art Of War"" and speaking about how violence should be a last resort, while the same characters seem only too willing to start doling out punches with all the testosterone-fuelled, unthinking abandon of a bunch of chavs fighting over a bag of chips.<br /><br />Character development does not exist in ""Clubbed"". Nor does irony, subtlety or pathos. This is a film which trades on fond memories of Guy Richie's early gangster films, which despite their flaws certainly had much more wit, better editing, snappier dialogue and packed more emotional punch than this limp little saga. They're a decade old now, anyway - isn't it time we moved on from trying to emulate them?",Negative,negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, criticizing the film ""Clubbed"" for its poor script, lack of character development, and unconvincing setting.

The reviewer also criticizes the film's attempt to emulate Guy Ritchie's gangster films, but failing to match their wit, editing, and emotional impact.

The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and dismissive, implying that the film is lazy and unoriginal.

6139,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Danny (Mel Raido) is a lonely factory worker who tries to get by with his job and to be a good dad to his two daughters after a messy divorce from their mother (Maxine Peake.) But after an altercation with said daughters present at a Working Men's Club, he uses a trip to their dance class to take a glance at Louis (Colin Salmon) and his gang of hard men who train in the boxing gym/free weights section there and to train himself into a tougher, more assertive person. Before long he's taken the philosophies of Louis to heart and has joined him as a nightclub doorman as the 80s disco faze kicks in...but when associate Sparky (Scott Williams) tries to do a sideline in drug dealing, everything turns pear shaped.<br /><br />As Robert De Niro once stated in the film A Bronx Tale 'there's no bigger tragedy than wasted talent.' The writer of Clubbed had a good idea and a talent to make it into some sort of film...but without the ability, it seems, to put it all together into some sort of coherent film.<br /><br />As a brummie, some of the filming locations (especially a scene at the end outside the Ring O' Bells pub in Moseley!) were quite easy and fun to spot...but the dour look of the cinematography is really a downer on things. Some really poor acting, for instance lead actor Raido with an indecipherable accent that's all over the place, and a hammy script with some misfiring dialogue are bigger problems for the film though. More established actors like Peake and even telly favourite Neil Morressey are sidelined to very small supporting parts, while the disastrous Raido and Ronnie Fox's lame villain take centre stage. Williams does a poor man's Sick Boy from Trainspotting impression, leaving Salmon and Shaun Parkes seemingly the only performers left with any integrity from the whole thing, as the excessive, blood splattered violence (becoming a common trend for Brit flicks!) takes over. Truly a missed opportunity. **",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, criticizing various aspects of the film ""Clubbed"".

The cinematography is described as ""dour"", and the acting is panned, with the lead actor's accent being deemed ""indecipherable"" and the script being labeled as ""hammy"". The reviewer also criticizes the underutilization of established actors, such as Maxine Peake and Neil Morressey, while the main actors, including Mel Raido and Ronnie Fox, are seen as lacking in talent. The only positive comments are reserved for Colin Salmon and Shaun Parkes, who are seen as the only actors to maintain their integrity in the film. The excessive violence is also seen as a negative aspect of the film.

The reviewer's tone is one of frustration and disappointment, implying that the film had potential but failed to deliver.

The reviewer is pointing out that the quote ""Clubbed is one of the best UK indie films I have seen in a very long time"" is misleadingly attributed to Screen International, when in fact it was a statement made by James Velaise, the president of Pretty Pictures, the French distributor of the film. The reviewer is suggesting that this quote is not an unbiased opinion, but rather a promotional statement made by someone with a vested interest in the film's success.

The reviewer is also questioning the authenticity of other quotes used in the film's marketing campaign, implying that they may be similarly misleading or fabricated. This critique highlights the importance of verifying the sources of quotes and endorsements used in film marketing, to ensure that they are genuine and trustworthy.

6141,"Mockumentaries are proliferating lately so much that the approach therefore needs an injection of fresh and creative material each time it's used to maintain its vitality. This film does not deliver anything but worn out retreads of similar stories, an aimless script, weak ad-libs, uninspired acting, and unfunny self-gratifying humor. <br /><br />The premise would seem promising enough; the legend of the Loch Ness monster is made to order for one of these goofy mockumentary misadventures, with a vast array of history and legend waiting to be tapped for outrageous satire. The film makers totally waste this enormous potential, however. We get some fool inserting a fake Nessie into the water. Gee, that's original. Another scene has one obnoxious idiot threatening another obnoxious idiot with a gun. Sidesplitting. Some gratuitous shots of a pretty girl in a bikini. Annette did that 40 years ago (and far better, by the way). Throughout the movie, somebody always seems to be yelling: I suppose this is designed to wake up the audience who have nodded off by this point.<br /><br />Worst of all, though, is the relentless salvo of those reality show type ""interview comments"" made by the characters. Not only do they nuke you with this tired joke every five seconds, but apparently, the actors also improvised; that's the only explanation for how humorless the jokes are. If lines like, ""I've never seen anyone write a book about non-evidence"" were actually scripted, then the writer should be shot on sight and fed to Nessie.<br /><br />No wonder Nessie got violent; it obviously saw this movie.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is extremely negative, criticizing almost every aspect of the film. The reviewer argues that the mockumentary approach has been overused and needs fresh ideas to remain effective, but this film fails to deliver. The script is deemed aimless, the ad-libs are weak, the acting is uninspired, and the humor is self-gratifying and unfunny. The reviewer expresses disappointment that the promising premise of the Loch Ness monster legend is wasted, and instead, the film resorts to unoriginal and tired jokes.

The review specifically targets the film's lack of creativity, citing examples such as the fake Nessie insertion, the gratuitous bikini shot, and the yelling scenes, which are meant to keep the audience awake. The reviewer is particularly scathing about the ""interview comments"" style of humor, which is overused and humorless. The improvised jokes are seen as a failure, and the scripted lines are deemed terrible.

The tone of the review is sarcastic and dismissive, with the reviewer even joking that the Loch Ness monster itself would be violent after watching this movie. The overall assessment is that the film is a complete failure, lacking in creativity, humor, and originality.

6142,"Christopher Guest is the master of the mockumentary. Werner Herzog is one of many documentary greats out there. Zak Penn isn't good at either but he could certainly take a lesson from the other two. Guest often plays around with reality and fiction but the line between the two is always clear in his films, sort of an essential with a mockumentary. Penn could also take a lesson from the The Blair Witch Project. Even though you knew it was a fake documentary going in you totally bought into the world the filmmakers created. It seems to the audience as if the whole thing is real even though you know, deep down, you're watching fiction. In other words, it was fiction successfully disguised as truth. In fact many early audiences watching it, at Sundance and other premiere audiences thought it was real. Penn, whose forte, by his own admission, is screen writing, should probably stick to that. Documentary or mockumentary film-making (and it's hard to tell where one begins and the other ends with this film) is obviously not. <br /><br />Penn sets the stage for what he tries to sell as a legit documentary on the filming of a documentary, sort of a meta-documentary. Penn, however, confuses the audience, and loses their trust, from the get-go as he enters Herzog's house before the filming of Herzog's film, ""Enigma of Loch Ness"" about the myth of the Loch Ness monster (a film which apparently was never finished  probably because of Penn's interference). Even though Penn is apparently the director of the film we're watching, he starts it by looking at the cameras and saying, ""What is the film crew doing here?"" and starts shying away from them. He does this on a couple other occasions as well. He will stop and tell the cameras to stop filming, thus forcing the camera guy to hide in the shadows to pick up snippets of dialogue between Herzog and Penn. It seems to be a gimmick, but that is never made clear, and Penn is apparently keeping us in the dark intentionally. This leaves the audience scratching its head wondering, ""Who is in charge here?"" If Penn is working against his own film crew what kind of a world are we a part of? This is just one of many examples of how he confuses the line between reality and fiction. <br /><br />Penn seems to only fully enter the fictional world (I think) when the crew has sightings of what appears to be the Loch Ness monster. But by the time the monster makes its first appearance we have totally exited the fictional world Penn has attempted to create, so it all just seems silly and pointless. <br /><br />This is a potentially fascinating movie and a real missed opportunity in that Penn has a chance to document a master at work, but completely loses focus and it becomes a movie about Penn and his antics instead of the filming of a documentary. Penn's presence begins to pervade and overshadow everything else in the movie. <br /><br />The Herzog interviews are convincing and we actually believe he isn't acting. We even start to wonder if he and others on his crew are being duped by Penn, much the way the audience is, but you're never sure of even that. Penn, in his interviews to the camera, attempts to be quirky and unintentionally funny, like the characters interviewed in a Guest mockumentary, but he only succeeds in being annoying. In a Guest film this effect is hilarious, while here it falls flat because you're never sure what Penn is about. As a result we, the audience, start to dislike him as much as the crew apparently does. Aside from the beautiful scenery and the superfluous appearance, out of nowhere, of a beautiful model, thrown in to give the movie spice, there is little to recommend here. Perhaps its only redeeming quality (an unintentional one at that) is that it's a great example of why the audience is important; and by completely ignoring the conventions of storytelling your doing them a disservice. For that reason alone I think this would be a good film to show to film students  sort of a ""what not to do"" kind of movie. I have nothing against a movie told in an unconventional way as long it's done skillfully, with a thematic base to give it substance. This film is completely lacking in that.<br /><br />I'd like to call it a valiant effort at something, but I'm not sure what it is, other than a complete mess and ultimately a waste of time. <br /><br />(As a side note: It seems like bad art always calls to mind good. This film made me think of the book ""Picture"" by Lillian Ross. Ross followed John Huston around during the filming of ""The Red Badge of Courage"" and brilliantly documented it for the New Yorker. It would make a great movie in fact. If you want a great example of meta-art, read it.)",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, criticizing Zak Penn's direction and approach to the mockumentary genre.

The reviewer criticizes Penn's decision to insert himself into the film, making the narrative unclear and self-indulgent. The film's attempts at humor and quirkiness fall flat, and the reviewer finds Penn's on-screen presence annoying.

The reviewer praises the Herzog interviews, which come across as genuine, but notes that Penn's presence overshadows the rest of the film.

I am not sure why anyone would have made this while the big-budget Spielberg version was slaying them at the box office. And if truth be told, neither version is all that hot.

6145,"Why does C Thomas Howell do these movies? Cruise (Howell's one time co-star) does a huge blockbuster of WOTW and Howell follows with this lame effort.<br /><br />Where do I start here? Production Values - I'll start with the good stuff. The look and feel of some of the scenes in this movie are not too bad to be honest. The set-ups are okay in spots and the direction not too bad.<br /><br />Script - Terrible. A series of clunky scenes that could have been put in any order you like permeate throughout the movie. The amount of times the scene faded to black and reemerged a second later in the same room was uncountable. Very poor storyline (but so was the Cruise WOTW) takes some blame but an abysmal screenplay kills it off.<br /><br />Special FX - Okay, I don't want to be too harsh here as I imagine the budget was smaller than Cruise's lunch bill - but in the overall context of the film the effects are badly done. Some shots are quite impressive - mainly far off destruction shots of bridges, Washington, liner. But in the main the ""alien"" machines and tentacles themselves are dreadful. Also the camera quality is fuzzy on some shots and cuts away entirely on others.<br /><br />Acting - I'm a fan of Howell but as he has reduced himself to acting in these low-budget flicks - he has succumbed to the ""over-acting"" bug a long time ago. Look at his performance in The Hitcher and compare it to this movie. There is no comparison. He overdoes his facial expressions, his flailing arms and legs (where did he get that running style???) and for a final coup-de-gras look at the scene where he loses the photo of his family. Hysterical. But after saying all that - he is still the best actor on show here. Busey is embarrassing to look at and Peter Green (Zed is truly dead now baby) mumbles incoherently through his one and only scene. I honestly could not understand one word he said - I even went so far as trying to enable the subtitles on that scene - but the DVD did not have subtitles. This seems to be a real keep-it-in-the-family affair too as Howell's son, the director's wife and the line producer all make it into the film. None of them are good.<br /><br />Direction - not bad but not good either.<br /><br />Score - Dismal.<br /><br />Overall, a lame duck effort that will do nothing for Howell in his attempt to make it back to the big time. He should take a look at Rourke and try to figure out how he made in back to the A list but if he keeps doing stuff like this, he won't have a career soon enough.<br /><br />3/10.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with almost every aspect of the movie.

The reviewer starts by acknowledging their low expectations due to the director's previous work, but still felt let down by the final product. The main criticism is that the film fails to deliver as a slasher film, particularly in terms of gore, which is a crucial element in the genre. The reviewer compares it unfavorably to the previous films in the franchise, implying that this installment is the weakest link.

The only positive comments are brief and superficial, focusing on the ""eye candy"" provided by the actresses in the film. However, this is not enough to redeem the film's overall shortcomings. The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and dismissive, with phrases like ""Shame on me"" and ""Come on now!!"" conveying their disappointment and frustration.

6151,"Slasher sequel (fourth SLUMBER PART MASSACRE film) concerns a group of nubile cheerleaders stranded in a mountainous cabin in the snow, being offed by a deranged killer.

Though it wears out its welcome eventually, even at its short length.<br /><br />Original star Brinke Stevens makes a cameo, which only seems to be there for the sake of including her in the movie.",Negative,Negative,Negative,positive,"This review is mixed, but leaning towards a negative perspective. The reviewer acknowledges that the film delivers on certain expectations of the slasher genre, such as gore and nudity, which might appeal to hardcore fans. However, they also criticize the film for lacking a plot and being overly formulaic. The mention of the film ""wearing out its welcome"" suggests that the reviewer found the experience tiresome and overly familiar. Additionally, the cameo by Brinke Stevens is seen as unnecessary and only included for the sake of her presence, implying a lack of meaningful contribution to the story.

The tone of the review is somewhat dismissive, implying that the film is unoriginal and lacking in substance. While it might appeal to a specific niche audience, the reviewer does not seem to hold the film in high regard.

6152,"Cheerleader Massacre was supposed to be the fourth installment of the Slumber Party Massacre series; if that's what they were doing (which it is considering ONE actress from the original returns in a small cameo role), they have failed miserably and made, by far, the worst installment of the 'quadrilogy'. Cheerleader Massacre seamlessly combines bad acting, a horrible plot, a dumb killer, dull and boring deaths, boring scenery, and hideous camera work to make it one of the worst films ever made. Did I already mention how bad it was? Don't get me wrong: this cheesy and retarded excuse for a horror film is nowhere near as bad as Napoleon Dynamite, but it is undeniably a horrible movie.<br /><br />Cheerleader Massacre is an exact polar opposite of the original Slumber Party Massacre.

6153,"I've never expected too much from a film by trashy B-movie director Jim Wynorski: a silly premise, some cheapo effects and a bit of nudity from some busty babes, and I'm usually fairly happy.<br /><br />Well, Cheerleader Massacre delivers on the former and definitely the latter, but unfortunately is a tad light when it comes to the splatter. And when a film has the word 'massacre' in the title, and scrimps on the gore, then Houston, we have a problem.<br /><br />Wynorski's movie centres on a group of cheerleaders who, along with their teacher, mini-bus driver and a couple of guys, become stranded in the mountains during a snowstorm. They make their way on foot to a deserted mountain retreat, where they find food and shelter. And a crazy killer who wants them all dead! From the outset, good old Jim ensures that his film features plenty of scenes loaded with T&A, and includes the obligatory shower scene, along with numerous other moments in which tasty women get nekkid (including a spot of raunchy softcore sex and a very gratuitous three-babes-in-a-hot-tub scene). None of the women look young enough to be cheerleaders (and are never even seen in their outfits), but who cares about such details when they're all too willing to strip off in the name of art?<br /><br />I do care, however, about the movie's numerous lacklustre deaths. With such an extremely lurid title, I had been hoping for some inventive bloodletting to go with all of the bums, bush, and boobs; instead, practically all of the killings occur off-screen or feature next to no gore. Only a silly post-decapitation scene (achieved with cheap-as-chips CGI) comes anywhere near to delivering the goods.<br /><br />Still, if you're feeling in the mood for some titillation, or a bit of slasher silliness minus the grue, then, at 82 minutes, at least Cheerleader Massacre won't be too much of a waste of your time.",Negative,Negative,Negative,negative,"This review is mixed, but leaning towards a negative perspective. The reviewer has low expectations from director Jim Wynorski, anticipating a B-movie with a silly premise, cheap effects, and some nudity. The film delivers on the latter, with plenty of scenes featuring nudity and suggestive content. However, the reviewer is disappointed by the lack of gore and inventive killings, considering the film's title ""Cheerleader Massacre"" promises a more intense experience. The deaths are described as ""lacklustre"" and mostly occur off-screen or with minimal gore, which is a significant letdown.

The reviewer does acknowledge that the film might still appeal to those seeking some titillation or slasher silliness without the intense violence. The film's short runtime of 82 minutes is also seen as a redeeming quality. Nevertheless, the reviewer's primary disappointment with the film's failure to deliver on its promise of a ""massacre"" overshadows any minor positives.

6154,"A movie like this makes me appreciate the work that professional actors do. I think movie-goers, in general, are a little too hard on professional actors and are ready to bash them for the most minuscule reasons. Just watch a couple minutes of ""Cheerlader Massacre,"" and trust me, you'll change your views. A razzie would be almost a compliment for these no-talent actors. But then again, it's a Jim Wynorski film. Wynorski is a popular director of these ultra low-budget B-movies (having worked with Roger Corman on many an occasion). The problem with this movie is it actually tries to develop a plot. And when you have actors delivering lines like they're reading letters off an eye chart, how am I supposed to care? In Wynorski's ""Bare Wench 2,"" he didn't try to develop a plot. He simply tried to make a softcore porn/goofy takeoff on the ""Blair Witch Project."" It was fun and it was titillating. ""Cheerleader Masscare"" is no fun. There are a couple obligatory female nude scenes, but they are few and far between. So it's not even worth enjoying on an erotic level. I must say, the worst scene is the one where Nikki Fritz walks across a bridge that's about to collapse. First of all, her character didn't have to walk across that bridge. Second of all, as the bridge starts creaking, rather than try her best to run across, she just stands there and acts helpless. And top it off, we don't actually see the bridge collapse because the filmmakers made this for a budget of 2 dollars!!! Unlike a lot of B-horror films, this one's actually boring. And that's what makes it the worst of all bad movies. One of the few bright spots was Lunk Johnson, who's probably the most natural actor in the film (though certainly no more than halfway decent). He was funny in ""Bare Wench 2,"" and had some funny scenes in this movie too.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing frustration and disappointment with the film ""Cheerleader Massacre"". The reviewer starts by acknowledging the challenges faced by professional actors, but quickly shifts to criticizing the film's poor acting, plot, and overall quality. The reviewer compares it unfavorably to another film by the same director, ""Bare Wench 2"", which was more enjoyable and didn't attempt to develop a plot. The reviewer specifically criticizes the film's attempt to develop a plot, which falls flat due to the poor acting and lack of effort.

The reviewer also expresses disappointment with the film's lack of erotic content, which is a key aspect of B-movies. The reviewer highlights a particularly cringe-worthy scene where the actress Nikki Fritz fails to react to a collapsing bridge, which is made worse by the film's extremely low budget. The only positive comment is about Lunk Johnson, who is described as the most natural actor in the film, but even that is tempered by the acknowledgment that he's only ""halfway decent"".

Overall, the review is scathing, with the reviewer concluding that the film is boring, which is the worst sin for a B-horror film.

6156,"Like CURSE OF THE KOMODO was for the creature feature genre, Jim Wynorski's CHEERLEADER MASSACRE is a straight-faced parody of slasher movies, such as SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE. A psycho, who has escaped from his padded cell,(..he was sent to the loony bin thanks to killing eleven people)is working across the mountainous backwoods countryside of Bobcat County attacking anyone within his reach. A van load of cheerleaders, their teacher, two equipment hands, and the driver are on their way to a contest when their vehicle runs out of fuel while taking a supposed short-cut to avoid having to turn back. Luckily the group find a cabin up ahead, but fall prey to a killer who attacks each victim one by one. The psycho loose in the county couldn't have killed one girl because she was in the cheerleaders' locker room while he was elsewhere which means someone among their own is the culprit. Meanwhile the sheriff of the county and his deputy pursue the whereabouts of their psycho, while also trying to find the location of the missing cheerleader squad.<br /><br />Shot cheap on video, Wynorski does what he can with the limited budget having to find clever ways to assassinate characters off-screen without the luxury of properly effective special effects. In other words, lots of melons were stabbed, the sound effect used to let us know that certain victims whisked away into the darkness by a black gloved hand died savagely. Wynorski incorporates a scene from SLUMBER PARTY MASSACRE regarding Brinke Stevens' character Linda, her being pursued by a killer with a drill(..that killer and Linda both wound up dead, but I guess Wynorski wanted to connect his film to that one, albeit rather poorly)..still it was nice to see her, even if it was a glorified cameo. Tamie Sheffield, as Ms Hendricks the teacher of the students in trouble, has a long bathing scene in the shower soaping her naked body and fake breasts. The girls who make up the cheerleaders are a bit unconvincing, because their obviously in their twenties. Aging soft-core porn stars Samantha Philips(..as a police officer who is attacked by the psychopath she's searching for)and Nikki Fritz(..a hiker who is victimized while jogging across a dangerous bridge)surprisingly don't have to strip. Wynorski vets Bill Langlois Monroe(..as Sheriff Murdock) and Melissa Brasselle(..as a detective who assists Murdock on his case)contribute to the sub-plot of the search for John Colton's serial killer McPherson. Interesting enough, the McPherson story serves as a McGuffan as, in truth, the meat of the film is devoted to the cheerleading group and their perilous situation. I'm not sure if slasher fans will embrace this movie because it takes too long for the kills to flare up and when they eventually enter the picture, the violence isn't potent or shocking enough to satisfy.",Negative,Negative,Negative,positive,"This review of ""Cheerleader Massacre"" is mixed, but overall, it leans towards a negative assessment. The reviewer acknowledges that the film is a parody of slasher movies, specifically referencing ""Slumber Party Massacre."" However, the reviewer notes that the film's low budget and cheap production values hinder its effectiveness. The use of off-screen killings and sound effects to imply violence is seen as a limitation rather than a clever workaround. The reviewer also criticizes the acting, stating that the cheerleaders are unconvincing and appear to be in their twenties, rather than high school age.

The review does mention some positive aspects, such as the inclusion of Brinke Stevens in a cameo role and the presence of soft-core porn stars Samantha Philips and Nikki Fritz, although they do not strip in the film. The reviewer also notes that the subplot involving the search for the serial killer McPherson serves as a McGuffin, and the main focus of the film is on the cheerleading group's perilous situation.

However, the reviewer concludes that the film may not satisfy slasher fans due to the slow pace of the killings and the lack of potent or shocking violence. Overall, the review highlights the film's limitations and shortcomings, making it a negative review.

6157,"This movie was one of those movies where it completely fooled me into thinking that it was a cheesy 80's slasher flick, based on the cover, but it wasn't. It was quite possibly one of the worst slasher films that I have ever seen. The picture on the cover did not match any part or scene in the movie; in fact it didn't involve a chainsaw. Not even the tag line fit the movie. The film is about a group of cheerleaders and two potheads who escape to a desolate cabin, in the cold woods, for a weekend getaway. However, things get extra chilly when they start to get murdered by an unknown killer. At the same time, the local sheriff's department is hunting down a dangerous killer. I'll name the problems in a list.<br /><br />1. The Acting. Boy was it cheap and horribly bad. It felt unnatural and it seemed as thought it was very scripted. None of the actors seemed as though they tried to perform with good intentions and therefore they seemed silly and tired. There was bad acting by all the characters in the movie, so I won't point out specific people, but I wills say that the stoners did a horrible job, as well as the police and the cheerleaders, which is not a surprise.<br /><br />2. The Plot. This story had set up a perfect storyline for good ol' fashion slasher flick, but instead they peppered it with plot-holes, useless and unnecessary scenes and an overall stupid back-story to the killer's intentions. There were major plot-holes including how the killer killed the last victim so quickly and yet still be there in the group of girls when it happened? The ex-con virtually served no purpose in the movie aside from being a useless plot device. There was random and unnecessary sex and nudity sprinkled throughout it, even for a b-movie or my taste it was a bit too much. As for the killer's intentions, lets just say it was stupid and it makes no sense as to why she / he is killing young girls. Plus, there was also some very predictable kills that I saw coming about 30 miles away.<br /><br />3. The Technical Side. The lighting was okay, it certainly wasn't the worse lighting that I've seen in a movie, but there were points where it was supposed to be dark but it looked more like the afternoon. The house seemed darker with the lights on, then with the lights off. The camera work was average, it didn't have any good establishing shots or amazing pans or zooms, thought it did get the job done is building some suspense with it's framing.<br /><br />Overall, this movie, in the sense of plot, character development and performance, was a huge disappointment and a waste of my time. What I thought would have been a great slasher flick turned out to be one of the worse movies that I have ever seen. The acting was really bad and wooden, there was hardly any sense in the plot and there was no emotion to this film. However, the technical aspect of this film saved it for me, because if the camera work or the lighting was bad, then I would have turned off the DVD player and popped in something else. I would recommend this movie to those who enjoy really cheesy b-movies as well as those who follow cult classics, because this movie certainly is. I would partially recommend this film for those who enjoy 80s slasher flicks.

6159,"Originally harped as a sequel to ""The Slumber Party Massacre"" series, this film falls flat on it's face with a new title. First off, if you are going to include the word ""massacre"" in your film's title, you better deliver. This one certainly does not. There is no gore, no on screen murders and no chainsaw, as the box art would lead you to believe. Instead, we get a paper thin, overdone plot about a group of cheerleaders who get stranded in an abandoned cabin on the way to a football game, only to be offed one by one. Again, this film could have been OK if the gore quotient was upped a bit. Why directors, especially those doing direct-to-video flicks, are afraid to show ANY gore is beyond me. Now, I am not a huge fan of excessive gore, but come on...why else would anyone rent a movie called ""Cheerleader Massacre??"" Besides that problem, the film suffers from a shot-on-a-home-video-camera cheapness. It looks cheap, sounds cheap, and the actors aren't all that good.

6160,"This movie was just plain bad. I can forgive low-budget films for being low budget but it wasn't funny, it wasn't smart, it had no redeeming qualities at all unless you really like looking at fake boobs. I don't know what this genre is classified as, possibly erotic horror, but if so-- well, it's neither sexy nor scary. Tying it into the Slumber Party Massacre movies was useless; I'd never seen the previous movies myself, and except for one scene that attempted to tie it together, I had no way of knowing who the escaped psycho killer in 'Cheerleader' was or why they were bothering with including him, especially because (and I don't think I'm revealing anything here) it was really obvious that the cheerleader killer in this film wasn't him. As for the actual murderer? All I can say is, lame. Really lame. When you find out why the killer is offing the cheerleading squad (and the squad's coach, and two stoners who happened to be on the bus trip they're taking, and the bus driver just for the heck of it, apparently) you will sit there and go-- WTF? Worst excuse for a murdering spree ever. The ""actors"" (two guesses why I added the quotes) generally looked like low-budget porn rejects, which they most likely were. Those poor people, trying to break into ""legitimate"" film. One of my friends had this to say about the actor who played Buzzy, the bus driver: ""He looks like the guy who, you know, gets really into it, and his face gets all red and stuff."" We had a good larf at that. Half of the other actors had all the skill and subtlety of the actors in the sixth grade production of ""Annie"" I just saw. The other half pretty much seemed bored to death (especially in the deleted scene, this one redhead...), and by ten minutes into this movie I was, too.<br /><br />A note: the DVD contains one deleted scene, which would've put the movie from R-rated to NC-17 if it had been left in.

6164,"Even as a big fan of the low to no budget horror genre, I couldnt find this disaster mildly amusing. With horrible acting, a painfully generic ""plot"" and no dimensional characters, no matter how bored and drunk you are, this one is not worth your 81 minutes. Don't make the same mistake I did. Rent something else. ANYTHING else!!!",Negative,negative,negative,negative,"This review is extremely negative, with the reviewer expressing their disappointment and frustration with the film. Despite being a fan of low-budget horror, they found this particular film to be a complete disaster, lacking in every aspect. The acting is described as ""horrible"", the plot as ""painfully generic"", and the characters as ""no dimensional"". The reviewer's tone is one of warning, advising readers not to make the same mistake they did and to rent anything else instead. The use of capital letters in ""ANYTHING else!!!"" emphasizes their strong disapproval of the film.

The reviewer's criticism is not constructive, and they do not provide any redeeming qualities or suggestions for improvement. The tone is dismissive and discouraging, implying that the film is a complete waste of time.

6165,"Before I start, I need to inform you that I love horror films with a passion. LOVE THEM! I have seen thousands and rarely does one come along that I do not like. I am very forgiving of the horror genre. One of the greatest lines in movie history is in the film ""Ed Wood"" where Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) freaks out and yells at the overly critical producers after they comment on ""Plan 9's"" cheap sets and continuity problems, ""You don't know anything! Haven't you ever heard of 'suspension of disbelief?!'"" Well, I try to bring that ""suspension of disbelief"" philosophy with me to every horror film I see and it usually works. Unfortunately, it didn't work for me during the screening of Cheerleader Massacre.<br /><br />Strike One:<br /><br />The first thing you'll notice about this ""film"" is that it is shot on video and has that crummy hand-held-home-digital-camera style. The camera work and quality are so bad it makes daytime soaps look breathtaking in comparison. In fact, it makes Troma and Full Moon video releases look good. And, that's bad.<br /><br />Strike Two:<br /><br />Jim Wynorski. This ""filmmaker"" probably fancies himself a chip off the ol' Corman, but nothing could be further from the truth. Roger Corman shot fast, furious and under budget, but was able to deliver a tight original film. Though Wynorski delivers a cheap film, he cheats his viewers (and perhaps other artists) as he steals entire pieces of James Horner's ""Humanoids From The Deep"" and ""Battle Beyond The Stars"" musical scores and inappropriately drops them into Cheerleader Massacre. On the back of the box art and during the beginning credits the music score is falsely attributed to, Dan Savio (an extra in Wynorski's ""Deathstalker II""). You will also notice how Cheerleader Massacre jumps from video to film and back again as Wynorski lifts entire scenes from both ""Slumber Party Massacre"" and ""Humanoids From the Deep."" Wynorski utilized this deception, fourteen years earlier, in his horrible version of ""Not of This Earth.""<br /><br />Strike Three (you're out):<br /><br />While Cheerleader Massacre does have some nudity, (40-year-olds playing teenagers and the grossest set of fake breasts that I have ever seen in a horror film, ugh), the murders are relatively bloodless. What the heck is that all about? The film is titled, Cheerleader Massacre, but a handful of off-screen killings, in my opinion, does not add up to a massacre. It doesn't even add up to a bad mosquito bite.<br /><br />The ""film's"" story is fair enough - unseen killer stalks a vanload of cheerleaders (old gals playing teens) until the van runs out of gas and the ""girls"" are forced to hold up in secluded two-story mountain home. I won't ruin the ending for you but this is one of those ""films"" where the person who is obviously the killer is not obviously the killer. Cheerleader Massacre would have been great if it were shot on film, directed by Joseph Zito and had special effects by Tom Savini. Instead it is an effect-less, shot-on-video travesty by Jim Wynorski. Ouch.<br /><br />I beg of you, please don't buy or rent this abomination. If we keep supporting these clowns, the more of this talentless video garbage they'll produce. Go out and rent ""The Prowler"", ""The Last House on Dead End Street"", ""Delirium"" or ""The Burning"" instead. You'll be glad you did.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing their disappointment and frustration with the film ""Cheerleader Massacre"". Despite being a self-proclaimed horror fan who is usually forgiving of the genre, the reviewer found this film to be subpar in multiple aspects. The reviewer lists three main issues with the film, which they refer to as ""strikes"".

The first issue is the poor camera work and video quality, which the reviewer compares unfavorably to daytime soaps and even Troma and Full Moon video releases. The second issue is the director, Jim Wynorski, who is accused of stealing musical scores from other films and passing them off as his own, as well as lifting entire scenes from other movies. The reviewer sees this as a form of deception and a lack of originality. The third issue is the film's failure to deliver on its promise of a ""massacre"", with relatively bloodless murders and a lack of gore.

The reviewer also criticizes the film's story, calling it ""fair enough"" but ultimately unimpressive. They express their disappointment that the film was not made with more care and attention, suggesting that it could have been improved with a different director and special effects team. The reviewer concludes by warning others not to waste their time or money on this film, instead recommending other horror movies that they consider to be superior.

6166,"When Jim Wynorski first announced he would be doing a new sequel for my favorite series of all time, the ""Slumber Party Massacre"" series, I was ecstatic. I had been waiting for a new installment for literally years. So, production began and very small bits and pieces on the shoot and the actors involved were released until the shoot wrapped. Then, the announcement of a title change. No longer would this new sequel be titled ""Slumber Party Massacre IV,"" but ""Cheerleader Massacre"" instead. I was a bit disappointed, but having a different title would be a very small price to pay for a film I had waited so long to happen. I was still extremely intrigued and on the edge of my seat to see it.<br /><br />Maybe a month ago, some very advanced copies of the film were released to some extremely lucky viewers, who got to see the film months before its release date. A few reviews leaked on the net and judging by them, I began to become apprehensive on Jim Wynorski's ""Cheerleader Massacre.""<br /><br />Tonight, I got to see the film for the first time in full length and I am still scratching my head. As I read in another review, ""Cheerleader Massacre"" is definitely NOT a new installment in the ""Slumber Party Massacre"" series, but a slasher flick all on its own. And a bad one at that.<br /><br />Before I get into the specifics of the film, let me first state what an enormous fan of Jim Wynorski's films I am. I always thought him to be a true camp genius, with a winner almost every time. Yes, his movies are made on shoestring budgets and don't contain the most top-notch acting around, but they're fun nonetheless. They are what they are: campy movies you watch when you want to have a good time. From ""Sorority House Massacre II,"" to ""Hard to Die,"" to ""Chopping Mall,"" Jim has produced the goods on more than one occasion. One of the reasons why I was excited that this film would be his latest project.<br /><br />""Cheerleader Massacre"" does not (in my opinion) reflect any of the films I had seen this director/writer create in the past. Firstly, the production was extremely inexpensive and the film was actually shot on videotape, something I had never seen Jim do before. The actors were mediocre, to say the least, and the story is almost laughable. The killer is also extremely stupid and reminds you more of your cuddly old grandpa, rather than an escaped lunatic.<br /><br />Of course, the film is littered with female nudity. This is a Jim Wynorski movie we're talking about, folks. But some of the boob-shots seen here almost seem like they were done for time. There is an extremely long shower scene, containing the cheerleading coach, that seems to go on forever and it greatly reflects a shower scene in Jim's ""Sorority House Massacre II."" The girl even bathes herself almost in the exact same way.<br /><br />""Cheerleader Massacre"" is also extremely cliched, to say the least. The opening scene is literally something we've all seen in HUNDREDS of past slasher flicks. A guy and a girl making out, on the verge of consummating their relationship when...you guessed it. They're hacked to pieces.<br /><br />Brinke Stevens, who I've never really considered to be a tremendous actress in the first place, also gives one of her stiffest and forced performances in her small cameo. We're talkin' possible cue cards here. She recalls some incidents her character endured by the killer seen here twenty years ago to the police, while footage of the original ""Slumber Party Massacre"" plays. Why was footage from the original film used if it was definitely not a new ""SPM""? I have no idea. There is also two explosions seen in this movie that I am almost certain were recycled from other films.<br /><br />Not only does this film recycle FOOTAGE from past films, but it also recycles the scores from other films as well. Some of the music used in ""Humanoids from the Deep"" (which was also recycled prior for ""The Coroner"") can be heard throughout the entire film. There are at least two more as well that I cannot identify, but am certain have been used before.<br /><br />After sitting through this film's horrendous acting, ridiculous story, non-existent gore/special effects, and camcorder-like quality, I am having some serious concerns toward Mister Wynorski's career. Has the man who delighted audiences with films in the past finally lost his niche? Only time will tell. Oh, and let's not forget his newest film. A new installment in the ""Sorority House Massacre"" films, now titled ""Final Exam."" I think I'm seeing a pattern here...",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, expressing disappointment and frustration with Jim Wynorski's film ""Cheerleader Massacre"". The reviewer, a self-proclaimed fan of Wynorski's work, was initially excited about the film, but their enthusiasm was short-lived. Upon watching the film, they were dismayed by the low production values, mediocre acting, and unoriginal storyline. The reviewer criticizes the film's clichéd opening scene, lack of gore and special effects, and the reuse of footage and music from other films. They also express concern about Wynorski's career, wondering if he has lost his touch.

The reviewer's tone is one of disappointment and disillusionment, as they had high expectations from Wynorski's previous work. The use of phrases like ""I am still scratching my head"" and ""I am having some serious concerns"" convey a sense of bewilderment and dismay.

The reviewer also points out inconsistencies in the film, such as characters wearing minimal clothing in cold mountain settings, which they find illogical.

6168,"Hmmmmmmm - cheerleader massacre. Let me think - high school girls get sliced up, except the cute one survives. Got it. Next movie.<br /><br />I was actually surprised this one was made in 2003. I really thought they quit making these movies in the 80's. This was truly your run of the mill slasher movie with teenage eye candy, dumb male horn dogs, even dumber male adult, and hot teacher. It continues on the list of dark and stormy night and abandoned cabin in the woods. We have seen it all before.<br /><br />However this one had a few interesting plot twists that places it above the normal me-too slashers, so if you have got a few brain cells to fry and 2 hours to kill - you could do worse.",Negative,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is mixed, but leaning towards a negative perspective. The reviewer starts by expressing a sense of familiarity and boredom with the film's plot, dismissing it as a generic ""cheerleader massacre"" with predictable elements like high school girls getting killed and the cute one surviving. The tone is sarcastic, implying that the reviewer has seen it all before and is not impressed. The comparison to 80's slasher movies reinforces the idea that the film is unoriginal and lacks innovation.

However, the reviewer does acknowledge that the film has some redeeming qualities, specifically mentioning a few interesting plot twists that elevate it above the typical slasher movie. This suggests that the film is not a complete waste of time, and if one has a few hours to kill, it might be worth watching. The tone remains somewhat dismissive, but there is a hint of begrudging respect for the film's attempts to stand out.

6169,"Directed by Jim Wynorski (Chopping Mall, Return of the Swamp Thing), Cheerleader Massacre is the fourth installment in the Slumber Party Massacre series. Just think about it: it's the fourth chapter of a slasher series that no one really cares about! So how could this even be good? Well, it's not! But since when did slasher films have to be good? Cheerleader Massacre is entertaining, that's for sure. But in the entertainment field, we've seen better, that's for sure too! As you can see, I'm not sure about where I stand concerning this movie. Those who watch slashers only for nudity will be more than satisfied. This movie's all boobs, but unfortunately no blood, or not enough. I think I'm being generous with this movie because I had a good time watching it and I really enjoy watching slasher movies, even as bad as they sometimes are. If you want me to be sincere, The Slumber Party Massacre Part 1 is the best one and all the others are a waste of time, so I guess I have a lot of time to waste!!

On one hand, the reviewer acknowledges that the film is entertaining, and they had a good time watching it, which suggests that it has some redeeming qualities. They also mention that fans of nudity in slasher films will be satisfied, implying that the film delivers in that regard. On the other hand, the reviewer is quick to point out that the film is not particularly good, and that it lacks sufficient blood and gore. They also compare it unfavorably to the first installment in the series, implying that it does not live up to the standard set by the original.

Despite the reviewer's ambivalence, their tone is generally lighthearted and playful, suggesting that they do not take the film too seriously. They seem to be aware of the film's flaws, but are willing to overlook them in favor of enjoying the film's campy, exploitative appeal. The reviewer's final recommendation to watch other, similar films (""Sleepaway Camp 2"" and ""Cheerleader Camp"") reinforces the idea that they are approaching the film from a tongue-in-cheek perspective.

6170,"On my continuing quest to find the worst movie of all time, my friends and I stumbled upon this little gem. It is hilarious through and through, especially if you don't know (like we didn't) that it's a semi-sequel to another horror series.<br /><br />I won't bother going into the plot except to mention that everyone complains about the horrible snowstorm that was coming (it was equivalent to the characters just screaming ""FORESHADOWING!"" at the camera and waving their arms), and, in some odd twist of fate, the snow storm ever occurs. Budget problems, I guess.<br /><br />Add that to a magical front door that is opened or closed depending on what scare effect the director wants to create and the electricity being cut off until the gym teacher decides to take a shower with lots of soap.

They mock the film's attempts at foreshadowing, pointing out that the characters' warnings of an impending snowstorm are laughable, especially since the storm never actually arrives.

The reviewer also ridicules the film's use of convenient plot devices, such as a magical front door that opens and closes at the director's whim, and a power outage that coincides with a character's decision to take a shower. They also make fun of the film's ridiculous plot twists, including the slasher's origin story, which involves a traumatic experience that is both absurd and hilarious.

6171,"After reading many good things about it ,i finally watched ""the clearing"".With a cast of great actors like Redford and Dafoe ,one would,at least, expect a decent film.After the closing credits had rolled i was still shocked by how bad and incoherent this movie actually was.<br /><br />Is it supposed to be an ""art"" film??I don't think so cause it is too melodramatic for that.The bad thing is that the drama seems way too forced and unrealistic.<br /><br />The truth is that the script makes absolutely no sense.First of all it never really explains the motive behind the actions of any of the characters,it just overblows their so called ""personal issues"".What's so bad about Redford's character's life that he has to ""clear it""??The fact that he cheats,occasionally,his wife??The guy is a millionaire who has had a good life,has a great son and a great daughter,a wife that loves him(and a girlfriend that also seems to be way above the generic mistress type of woman)o and a new-born grandson.The only problem seems to be that he...has been working hard for all his life to be a successful person.So what??It seems that his hard work has really paid off and there's actually no real problems with his life.<br /><br />Then we come to Dafoe's character:here's someone who was a manager for one of Redford's companies and was fired.Why is this guy unemployed for ...eight years???It seems that he must have some kind of good education to have a job like the one he had in the first place and seems to have been a man with solid ideas about his work(as evident by his flashback of a conversation that he had with Redford when he was working for him).Why couldn't a man like that get a decent job and have a decent life??Cause he was ,once,fired??Totally unrealistic.<br /><br />The film really tries to portray these men as ""tortured souls"" or something and that comes off as really cheesy.In fact i would say that if the creators of this film were trying to say something about the American dream then they failed miserably.<br /><br />As for the actual events that take place during the movie ,they also make no sense at all.In fact the last 20 minutes of the film come off as an insult to the viewer's intelligence,because there's not one thing that takes place that actually makes any sense.Redford seems to have about a 1000 chances to escape ,yet he doesn't.At one moment he is ready to escape and yet he misses his chance cause he feels sorry for his kidnapper and doesn't want to hurt him!!!Then Dafoe picks up his gun from the water and the mud,which should be useless(if you fire a shot with a gun after the gun has been in the water and mud it will possibly blow up in your face)and the gun is in perfect condition!!! The way an unemployed ,useless(as portrayed in this film) and mentally unstable character,manages to outsmart the entire FBI with such ease brings the narrative of this film to ""twilight zone"" levels.The cheesy ending(with Redford's wife illusion) comes to finish the viewer off.<br /><br />This film pretends to be something,it's not(i.e a quality,sophisticated psychological thriller).Unfortunately it fails so hard,that it becomes a disaster and that's the word that describes this film best:A DISASTER.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing shock and disappointment at the poor quality of the film ""The Clearing"".

6174,"I wanted to like this film, and certainly there is room for a psychological character-driven movie which doesn't go for the cheap thrills. Yet, for the enjoyment of a movie, one requires a believable plot, some pacing and editing, and a feeling of involvement.

Nothing much really happens, and the so-called character-driven angles (as expressed by the director in his commentary) really don't add up to much.<br /><br />Fine actors are wasted here. Robert Redford does his best trying to engage and outwit Willem Dafoe. Dafoe brings a bit of nuance to his character, insofar as one can feel somewhat sympathetic towards him.

The story was old and has been shown in 100+ other movies and 1000+ TV series/movies. The main problem was basically: Nothing is happening. Take a kidnapping, let the villain make the wife of the kidnapped man deliver the money, make the police look stupid and boring and extend this to 95 minutes, you got your ""Clearing"" movie. The only 2 reasons I did not rate this a 1 was a) Dafoe and b) the ""plan-B-ending"". There are not many endings you can give a kidnapper movie ... 75% of these kind end with ending A, 20% end ending B and 1% ends with something unforeseeable. Boring, boring, boring.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer strongly advising against watching the movie. The reviewer expresses disappointment and frustration with the film, citing a lack of originality in the storyline, which they claim has been done numerous times before in other movies and TV series. The main criticism is that the plot is uneventful, with too much repetition and a lack of engaging action. The reviewer also criticizes the portrayal of the police as ""stupid and boring,"" which further adds to the overall dullness of the film.

The only redeeming qualities mentioned are William Dafoe's performance as the villain and the unexpected twist at the end, which the reviewer refers to as the ""plan-B-ending."" However, these positives are not enough to outweigh the reviewer's overall dissatisfaction with the film. The reviewer's tone is dismissive and sarcastic, with phrases like ""Do not watch this movie"" and ""Boring, boring, boring"" emphasizing their strong negative opinion.

6177,"It has been a long time since I have been to a movie as lame and boring as this one. It is one thing to have a slow pace where characters are being developed in a progressive way, or some aspect of the movie clearly is enhanced by such pacing (such as 'Lost in Translation""). However, there is a difference between slow progression and outright stalling, as happened in this one. I guess from the look on Helen Mirren's face she must have been distraught by the disappearance of her husband!! Surprise, surprise!! What a marvelously creative moment the meeting of the mistress and wife was.(sarcasm) And what a great way that the whole story fell apart at the end. Truly a masterpiece.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is extremely negative, with the reviewer expressing their disappointment and frustration with the film. They criticize the pacing, calling it ""lame and boring,"" and imply that the slow pace is not justified by any meaningful character development or plot progression. The reviewer also sarcastically comments on specific scenes, such as Helen Mirren's reaction to her husband's disappearance, implying that the acting is unconvincing or over-the-top. The meeting between the mistress and wife is also mocked, suggesting that the scene is clichéd and unoriginal. The reviewer's tone is one of disdain, with phrases like ""Surprise, surprise!!"" and ""Truly a masterpiece"" being used to convey irony and sarcasm.

The reviewer's criticism is not limited to specific scenes, but also extends to the overall narrative structure, stating that the story ""fell apart at the end."" This suggests that the reviewer found the plot to be poorly constructed and unsatisfying. The comparison to ""Lost in Translation"" implies that the reviewer has seen slow-paced films that are well-executed, making their criticism of this film even more scathing.

The reviewer criticizes the script, suggesting that Hollywood has run out of talented writers. They express disappointment in the performances of usually reliable actors, such as Willem Dafoe and Robert Redford, implying that they may be past their prime or struggling to find good material.

The reviewer specifically targets the dialogue, calling it ""long and terribly heavy-eyed,"" particularly in scenes featuring the family at home. They seem to doubt that the actors genuinely believed they were working on a hit film, possibly even an Oscar contender. The tone is sarcastic and dismissive, with the reviewer questioning the actors' judgment and the film's overall quality.

The outcome of the kidnapping is deemed predictable and stupid, and the fate of the kidnapper is seen as silly.

6180,"What an atomic bomb of a movie. The story goes nowhere and comes fron nowhere. It leaves the theatre goer with ones arm up saying ""is this it"". What happened to Redford. He was once a fair actor. Now he thinks that he can show up on the set and make a few scenes and it's a take. Wrong. What an unemotional film. I don't mean to be so so cruel, but what crap of a movie. Unbelievable amateur crap. If I was in this movie I would be so embarased that I would not show my face.

This movie will go down in the annals of movie making as the king of bombs with which all others will be compared to.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is an unbridled expression of disdain and disappointment towards the film. The reviewer's tone is scathing, with phrases like ""atomic bomb of a movie"", ""unemotional film"", ""amateur crap"", and ""king of bombs"" conveying their utter disgust.

The reviewer implies that Redford has become complacent, thinking he can coast through scenes without effort, resulting in a subpar performance. The reviewer's frustration is palpable, as they express embarrassment on behalf of those involved in the film, implying that association with this movie would be a source of shame.

The reviewer's language is intentionally harsh, with no attempt to provide constructive criticism or balance their negative comments with any positive aspects. The tone is confrontational, with the reviewer seemingly taking pleasure in lambasting the film. The use of hyperbole, such as comparing the film to an ""atomic bomb"", further emphasizes the reviewer's strong negative emotions.

6181,"I'm sorry but i don't understand how the studio get's away with this. The movie is just not worth it. Maybe as a theater-play but certainly not as a movie! And why do they call it a thriller??? Offcource the acting is good but i did'n't expect anything less from these perfect actors. Robert Redford plays very well and Willem Dafoe is convincing enough as the softy ""bad guy"". Helen Mirren can play almost any role and always (still) looks beautiful to me ;). I'm also a fan of her British detectives. Still they just can't save this ow so boring movie, i'm sorry. I hope we don't get to many movies anymore from this director ""Pieter Jan Brugge"" cause he obviously doesn't now the meaning of the words ""suspence and thriller"".",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is predominantly negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with the film. The reviewer questions how the studio could release such a subpar movie, implying that it's not worth watching. They suggest that the story might be more suitable as a theater play, implying that it's not engaging enough for a cinematic experience. The reviewer also takes issue with the film being marketed as a thriller, implying that it lacks suspense and excitement.

The only positive comments are reserved for the actors, with the reviewer praising the performances of Robert Redford, Willem Dafoe, and Helen Mirren. However, even these compliments are tempered by the reviewer's overall disappointment with the film. The reviewer's criticism of the director, Pieter Jan Brugge, is particularly scathing, implying that they don't understand how to create suspense or a thrilling experience.

The reviewer's tone is one of disappointment and frustration, with a sense of wasted potential. The negative comments far outweigh the few positive remarks, making it clear that the reviewer did not enjoy the movie.

6182,"I had never heard of ""The Clearing"" until I was really bored one day with some friends in the local Blockbuster and it grabbed our attention. The description on the DVD jacket grabbed our interest, but once we popped it into the DVD player, the boredom was only beginning.<br /><br />The story was dragged out for waaaay too long. It seemed to follow the same outline as other movies which include a kidnapping. The most suspenseful parts were in the beginning of the movie, however. After that, the outline was followed exactly and that made ""The Clearing"" unoriginal. The flashbacks were too many in number and the grief of the victim's family provided nothing interesting nor enhanced the nature of the film. And I also found that I did not like the ending, so that probably led to me not liking the movie at all.<br /><br />The acting was not horrible...it wasn't the greatest, though. Robert Redford has given much better performances. Willem Dafoe's tragic character was the only one I really saw develop throughout the story line and the viewer only really sees that change in the last ten minutes or so in the movie. Helen Mirren's portrayal as Robert Redford's wife was flat and sort of followed the same generic mold as other movies which include a tragic and heart-splitting event.<br /><br />In my opinion, ""The Clearing"" is nothing to rave about. Use your movie rental money on something else...like ""Garden State,"" perhaps?",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is decidedly negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and boredom with the film ""The Clearing"". The reviewer's initial interest in the film, sparked by the DVD jacket description, quickly turned to disappointment as the story unfolded. The reviewer criticizes the film's predictable and unoriginal plot, which follows a familiar kidnapping storyline, and the excessive use of flashbacks that fail to add depth to the narrative. The reviewer also expresses dissatisfaction with the film's pacing, stating that the most suspenseful parts are in the beginning, and the rest of the movie drags on.

The reviewer also critiques the acting, stating that while it's not horrible, it's not impressive either. The only notable performance is Willem Dafoe's, but even that is limited to the last ten minutes of the film. The reviewer is particularly unimpressed with Helen Mirren's portrayal, which is seen as flat and generic. The reviewer concludes by advising readers to spend their movie rental money on a different film, such as ""Garden State"", implying that ""The Clearing"" is not worth watching.

6183,"like in so many movies of the past, you would think Hollywood would learn this by now, makes for a very disappointing movie, not to mention, make sure the kidnapped victim is alive first before paying the ransom.<br /><br />Maybe this film wants to remind of these basic facts in case it should ever happen to one of us. Why the long walk in the woods and can a city guy really go through the woods without getting lost? Just an opportunity for some sentimental dialog that was meaningless in the end.<br /><br />I had to listen to part of the director's comments in the special features section, from the great moves that Redford has made in the past, (Sneakers for one) surprised he agreed to star in such a film. The director's comments and reasons were weak.<br /><br />The best parts of this movie was the scenery, can't wait for spring to come.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, expressing disappointment and frustration with the film's narrative and character development. The reviewer criticizes the movie for its predictable and unrealistic plot, specifically the handling of the kidnapping and ransom scenario. They question the logic of the characters' actions and the inclusion of unnecessary scenes, such as the long walk in the woods, which they deem as sentimental and meaningless.

The reviewer also expresses surprise and disappointment that Robert Redford, an actor known for his involvement in quality films, agreed to star in this movie. They imply that the director's comments in the special features section were unconvincing and weak, further solidifying their negative opinion of the film.

The only positive comment made is about the scenery, which the reviewer finds visually appealing and evocative of the arrival of spring. However, this brief praise is vastly overshadowed by the reviewer's overall dissatisfaction with the film.

I'm not just saying that because I'm used to better movies. I'm saying that it was almost down there with ""Kazaam"". The fight scenes were terrible (blurry cameras and no real fighting) and the plot was your typical ""stupid kung-fu plot"". If you are going to have a plot this stupid (see 'man turns into woman to become all-powerful then falls in love with Jet Li') you best have some great fighting to go with it.

6187,"I have to say that there is one redeeming speck in regards to this ""film"". It firmly establishes the bottom of the barrel. Now filmmakers know what to aim above when making a movie. Other than that I regret watching this debacle. What shameless abandon the making of this ""film"" was. What a waste of $100,000 (that's right folks, ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND dollars). This ""film"" reminds me of that ""Adult Video Awards"" show in which of group of ""industrial prostitutes"" stand up a praise themselves, believing that they are real actors, actresses and filmmakers. Ironic then how I've watched blue movies with better acting, directing and writing. I also found it funny that the Executive Producer, Justin Ament, just had to be in the ""movie"". He plays Deputy Jake Barker. I'm sure his ""acting"" career has taken off... Ted Pfiffer, the writer, has a part. He no doubt was wallowing in the clichéd glory he created. It should be noted that Carrie Finklea has a lead role in the movie. You might remember her from Gus Van Sant's 'Elephant'. Though I'm not too sure that she'll want to write this film on her resume. And I'm not sure which is a more depressing point; money was spent to make this film or people are going to watch it.

6189,"This is a new approach to comedy. It isn't funny.<br /><br />The joke is that this, in and of itself, is supposed to be funny.<br /><br />The story is based on a French short story, located in Paris, and the characters have French names. Louis Aubinard, for example ... played by ... Bob Hoskins? The movie also stars the equally French Jeff Goldblum and Natasha Richardson. The situations are similar to and the characters perform as if in those Carry-On movies from years back.<br /><br />I believe these are also jokes - to cast these actors who make no attempt to act French in any way, to have them cavort in the manner of broad English dance hall comedy, and to leave the whole bloomin' mystery unexplained to the audience.<br /><br />In the humour department, this is practically the Algonquin Round Table, isn't it?<br /><br />The movie tries to be charming and quirky, and I guess these characteristics are sort of funny. Not as funny as Duck Soup or Love and Death, perhaps, but funnier than The Deer Hunter or The Battleship Potemkin.<br /><br />It is an example of personal filmmaking. It makes no real effort to reach out and share with the audience, but stays true to its premise and its internal logic. Although all the situations are unbelievable, they are logical within the film's own bizarro world.<br /><br />I generally like this kind of eccentric movie, but I found this one to be paced too slowly, to be dull-witted, tedious, and to provide too few pleasurable surprises or genuine wit. It just kind of meanders in predictable and sophomoric ways, and wastes some wonderful talents along the way. It has to be the low point in the career of each of the major stars, who are all otherwise distinguished players. I found it to be the biggest waste of talent since The Betsy, and I wish I had never seen Goldblum and Hoskins in this thing.<br /><br />So, call it an interesting miss, and pass on it as a rental unless you really have a lot of time to kill.<br /><br />",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is largely negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with the film's attempt at comedy. The reviewer sarcastically remarks that the film's humor is non-existent, and that the casting of non-French actors in French roles, without attempting to act French, is supposed to be a joke, but falls flat. The reviewer also criticizes the film's pacing, calling it slow, dull-witted, and tedious, and states that it wastes the talents of its distinguished cast.

The reviewer does acknowledge that the film is an example of personal filmmaking, staying true to its premise and internal logic, but this is not enough to redeem the film's overall lack of wit and humor.

The costumes the unflattering photography - unflattering towards the actors but loving towards the locations) The one thing that makes the whole thing bearable is the sight of Meryl Streep making a fool of herself. No chemistry with her friends (Christine Baranski and Julie Walters) think of Streep with Lily Tomlyn in the Altman film and you'll understand what I was hoping for. I was embarrassed in particular by Pierce Brosnam and Colin Firth.

The tone is critical, with the reviewer likening the film to a loud, relentless action movie, implying a lack of subtlety and nuance. The reviewer questions the director's intentions, suggesting that they may not have a clear vision or understanding of the musical genre, citing the work of renowned directors like Stanley Donen, Vincent Minnelli, and George Sidney as examples of how it should be done.

The reviewer criticizes the film's structure, calling it a ""mess,"" and expresses disappointment with the costumes and photography, which they find unflattering to the actors. The only redeeming quality mentioned is Meryl Streep's performance, which the reviewer finds entertaining, but even that is not enough to save the film. The reviewer also expresses disappointment with the lack of chemistry between Streep and her co-stars, Christine Baranski and Julie Walters, and compares it unfavorably to Streep's work with Lily Tomlin in an Altman film.

6191,"There's no better way to describe the HORRENDOUS experience that's to watch Mamma Mia: Hitler must be looking up, saying to the pseudo-director Phyllida Lloyd 'You monster, what have you done?'<br /><br />Everything about the movie is wrong. Just Wrong! Even its success, which is unexplainable. I can understand when those crappy parody movies, like Epic Movie, make their minimal share of money and turn profit just because they're cheap (of course they are!). But when something like Mamma Mia makes 450 million dollars worldwide, you think 'what the hell is wrong with the world?'<br /><br />And to think we have Meryl Streep, one of the greatest alive actresses of the world, in it? What was she thinking? 'I need the money', she could say. Well then, sell one of your grandchildren, even that would be less embarrassing. It's not that Meryl is good in a disastrous piece of, err, 'movie'. She's also disastrous! When she sings, even though she's got the vocals, it's ridiculous. Worse than her only Pierce Brosnan. He used to be James Bond. Now he's singing Abba in a purple spandex during the credits of the worst movie ever. Really? And when I mention Abba, not that I have anything against the band and their music. Though it doesn't help them when actors started singing (badly), dancing (worse) and the extras join then (They pop out of nowhere! Frequently!) to present one terrible musical sequences after the other. You wanna cry when the music starts. And I love musicals! But this is the first in the genre where you PRAY for actual silence.<br /><br />I could keep going. The list goes on forever.

The reviewer's tone is one of utter disgust and disbelief, with the film being described as a ""HORRENDOUS experience"" and the director, Phyllida Lloyd, being referred to as a ""monster."" The reviewer expresses bewilderment at the film's commercial success, questioning the sanity of the audience and implying that the world has gone mad.

The reviewer specifically targets the performances of Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan, describing them as ""disastrous"" and ""ridiculous."" The musical numbers are also lambasted, with the reviewer stating that they would rather experience silence than listen to the actors' singing. The review is replete with hyperbole, with the reviewer claiming that the film's mistakes could fill a Stephen King novel and that its success is a sign of the apocalypse.

The reviewer's sarcastic tone and use of rhetorical questions (""What the hell is wrong with the world?"") add to the overall sense of outrage and disdain. The final sentence, which appears to be a tongue-in-cheek recommendation to watch the film, is likely intended to be ironic, as the reviewer has made it clear that they believe the film is an unmitigated disaster.

I readily admit that I didn't really want to see this movie and went with some friends who did, but for the love of God. Why does my gender shriek and squeal to convey delight?

The reviewer does acknowledge that Meryl Streep gives a good try, but even her efforts are not enough to redeem the film.

6193,"I don't know where most of you were at, but where I watched the film we didn't have people singing as some have told they experienced, we had people laughing, mostly at the campy plot line, the horrible dance sequences and the singing of the likes of Brosnan. The only people in the audience who seemed to be enthralled with the film were the seventies generation folks who were some how reliving the past with the songs. I was a DJ in the seventies and even went to the ABBA concert at Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton in Sept of 79, so I did appreciate them then and I still do now. But this film should have gone the same way as their marriages and ended in divorce. The sequences were so poorly staged, the dubbing and editing absolutely horrible and this has to be Meryl's worst production. I cannot believe an academy award winner would stoop so low as to do this piece of garbage. So save your money, wait for it to come out on DVD and then maybe spend your money on something better, like cat litter.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing strong disappointment and frustration with the film. The reviewer's experience of watching the film was marred by the audience's laughter at the ""campy plot line,"" ""horrible dance sequences,"" and Pierce Brosnan's singing. The reviewer, who claims to be a fan of ABBA and has a personal connection to the music, is shocked that an Academy Award winner like Meryl Streep would be involved in such a poorly made film. The reviewer specifically criticizes the staging, dubbing, and editing, calling the film ""garbage"" and advising readers to save their money and wait for the DVD release.

The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and dismissive, with a dash of anger and disappointment. The comparison of the film to cat litter is a clear indication of the reviewer's low opinion of the film. The reviewer's personal connection to the music and their experience as a DJ in the 1970s adds credibility to their criticism, making their negative assessment of the film more convincing.

6194,"I love musicals, all of them, from joyous Oklahoma, to Poignant Porgy and Bess, to the touching romantic ""Damn Yankees."" And I know most of the songs, sometimes singing them spontaneously, with a crowd or humming them alone.<br /><br />In a ""real"" musical, as differentiated from this vaudeville show, every song is painstakingly crafted to fit the exact moment. It is an expression of sadness, regret, love, joy or exaltation--a natural extension where mere words fail. So, in Guys and Dolls, ""My Time of Day"" describes the adventurous life of Sky Masterson as it is about to be compromised by the most unlikely woman. Every song in this brilliant exemplar of the genre sets a mood, or develops a character, creating a phantasmagoria of place, turned absolutely believable by the self disclosing evocations of song.<br /><br />For this lover of the Broadway Musical, and their adaptations to the screen during the last half of the 20th century, Mama Mia is somewhere between satire and a cruel fun house distortion of the genre. There, the songs of these musicals advanced the often elaborate, often delightful, plot lines. While here, the songs, simply picked up from a collection, only interfered with the shaky premise of the film.<br /><br />Perhaps most of those viewers who are making this film into a monumental success simply have no exposure to the art form of 20th century Musicals. They have no idea of the magic performed by writer and lyricist that can turn a dance hall floozy into someone whom we know and love, as achieved in ""Sweet Charity.""<br /><br />Let me offer an apology for the arrogance of this review. Perhaps, another day, another mood, I could have gotten into it, and not have been so critical in this review.<br /><br />But I can't help but imagining what Richard Roger, Oscar Hammerstein, Cole Porter, Irving Berlin and so many others could have done even with with this silly premise. I think about it, while the memories of seeing this film is fresh, and I can not help but to mourn the great loss.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is a scathing critique of the film ""Mamma Mia"" from a self-proclaimed lover of musicals. The reviewer sets the tone by expressing their admiration for classic musicals, highlighting the importance of songs being carefully crafted to advance the plot and evoke emotions. They then contrast this with ""Mamma Mia"", which they see as a shallow and misguided attempt at a musical. The reviewer argues that the songs in ""Mamma Mia"" are simply inserted without serving a narrative purpose, disrupting the already weak premise of the film.

The reviewer's tone is one of disappointment and frustration, lamenting the loss of the art form of 20th-century musicals. They imply that the film's success is due to the audience's lack of exposure to genuine musicals, and that the creators of ""Mamma Mia"" failed to understand the magic of classic musicals. The reviewer's apology for their arrogance is a nod to their strong emotional response to the film, which they see as a missed opportunity.

6195,"After sitting through this film, I have decided that it is one of the WORST movies I have ever seen. I knew it the moment I was subjected to three teenage girls screaming and overacting when they (OMG!) meet again, and then watching the same thing, only done by women old enough to be my mom. And that was only the first few minutes. Yeesh. So here are my comments...<br /><br />1. Middle aged women + ridiculous dance moves complete with hip thrusts and over the top costumes = not a good idea.<br /><br />2. Pierce Brosnan could not sing his way out of a paper bag. Nor could practically anyone else in this pile of excrement, for that matter.<br /><br />3. The songs were so random. It was obvious to me that they were thrown, willy nilly, into the incredibly contrived and STUPID plot.<br /><br />4. My three year old nephew could have written a better script.<br /><br />I was either cringing or laughing derisively during the movie. And I normally really like movie musicals. Of course they are bound to be a bit corny...but this was ridiculous. What a waste of talent.

6196,"This movie is pathetic not because it's poorly directed, acted, sung, danced, filmed, etc ... but because it's really difficult to ruin a movie using an ABBA soundtrack - yet, unfortunately, this is the only thing the movie succeeds in doing.

The director of Mama Mia is proof that you don't need talent to be a director - all you need are ABBA songs.<br /><br />Just to give a sample of the awfulness: An aging Meryl Streep is shot with close-ups in the harsh sunlight singing and just ruining the song with all the distracting wrinkles on her face.

The reviewer sarcastically suggests that the director's lack of talent is masked by the strength of the ABBA songs, implying that anyone could have directed the film and achieved similar results.

The reviewer specifically criticizes the film's treatment of Meryl Streep, a highly acclaimed actress, by using close-ups in harsh sunlight that accentuate her wrinkles, thereby ruining the song. This criticism implies that the film's cinematography and direction are misguided and unflattering, even to the point of undermining the talents of its lead actress.

But 'Mamma Mia' - utter, utter cr**. I like ABBA, I like the songs, I have the old LPs. But this film is just terrible. The stage show looks like a bit of a musical, but this races along with songs hurriedly following one another, no characterisation, the dance numbers (which were heavily choreographed according to the extras on the DVD) are just thrown away with only half the bodies ever on screen, the dance chorus of north Europeans appear on a small Greek island at will, while the set and set up of numbers would have disgraced Cliff Richard's musicals in the sixties!Meryl (see me I'm acting)Streep can't even make her usual mugging effective in an over-the-top musical!

The reviewer then proceeds to ridicule the film, pointing out absurd and unbelievable scenes, such as a voice-activated rocket that chases Salman Khan's character, and a marriage ceremony that is stalled by a sudden confession. The reviewer questions the logic and coherence of the plot, criticizing the random appearances and disappearances of characters, and the unnecessary inclusion of songs.

The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and dismissive, with a clear intention to dissuade others from watching the movie. The use of phrases like ""IQ of .001"" and ""foolish audience"" implies that anyone who enjoys this movie lacks intelligence or good taste. The reviewer concludes by stating that the movie is a ""must avoid"" and that they have taken a pledge to never watch a Salman Khan movie again unless it wins an Oscar, which they consider highly unlikely.

6211,"I just don't know how this stupid, crap, junk, garbage & good for nothing film is a blockbuster. It was so boring with a very, very weak (or no) story-line and wasn't even a jot funny. The film was about 135 minutes of only a paragraph of story about Prem (Salman Khan) is a love guru and is helping hapless & romantic Bhaskar (Govinda) to get the girl he wants. I'm not saying that I didn't like the film because it wasn't funny or anything, I will accept a movie that is not funny but has a decent story. The only two reasons why I can say it's a super-hit are: <br /><br />1. Salman Khan & Govinda are on-screen together but there first time together was in Salaam e Ishq which was a flop so it can't be. But it was a really good movie.<br /><br />2. Salman Khan's name is Prem and all the films with that name have been a hit including Maine Pyar Kiya. So it's just luck.<br /><br />I heard that it's a remake of Hitch, I've not seen it & I'm glad I didn't. Music is OK the only good songs are Do you want a partner, You're my love & Soni De Nakhre but what is the use of it in a really bad film, that too, if you have someone like Katrina Kaif who dances with two left feet? She is completely crap. Neither she knows acting, language (her voice is always dubbed for her), dance and always fails to impress.

The reviewer sarcastically labels any opposing views as ""Haterade"" (a colloquialism for ""fuel for hatred""), implying that the film presents a narrow-minded and intolerant perspective.

The reviewer's criticism stems from the film's perceived agenda to proselytize and suppress dissenting opinions, rather than encouraging open discussion or critical thinking. This perceived bias and lack of nuance lead the reviewer to express a negative opinion of the film.

6220,"Okay, I sensed that a film by Mormons, about Mormons, for Mormons would be a disaster waiting to happen, but little did I know how so very painful it would be. A little known fact is that Mormons have always made exceptionally fine propaganda films. The Church's official cinematic campaign has produced rare and lasting gems that transcend the Mormon community, including the wonderful short film ""Cipher in the Snow"" which ended up making the rounds as an educational film in the late 70's. Then there's Neil LaBute's disturbingly masterful ouvre....<br /><br />However, the success of these films depended largely on the fact that they didn't focus on Mormons or any specific Mormon theology. Instead they opt to focus on a universal theme and deal with it on a basic human level. ""God's Army"" abandons any pretext of universality and runs headlong into the stilted and myopic world of the orthodox. While this might be enough to alienate anyone but the most devoted Mormon, director Richard Ductcher's ineptitude as a filmmaker and his juvenile approach to storytelling are sufficient grounds to judge ""God's Army"" unwatchable by almost any standard.<br /><br />Dutcher's own appallingly wooden acting sets the tone for his army of the least interesting Mormons you're ever likely to meet. Of course the cast's sorry performances aren't helped any by Dutcher's pathetic script. He should be given credit for not avoiding some of the more controversial aspects of the Church, but, as can be expected, he conveniently frames these controversies in a sympathetic light. It should also come as no surprise that most of the answers to the Church's darker side are addressed with little other than faith. At one point an African-American missionary is scolded by a black couple for joining a church that was segregated up until 1978 (some ten to twenty years after nearly every congregation in the most degenerate parts of the deep South had already done so). Instead of addressing the Church's actively racist history, perhaps the sorest spot in Mormon theology which even Church leaders don't defend anymore, Dutcher's troubled character instead ponders Joseph Smith's murder--an obvious and perhaps outrageous allusion to lynching. Top off this syruppy milktoast with third grader leper jokes passing as comic relief and you have a strong case for the revival of silent films.<br /><br />If you knew little about Mormons before watching this film, you might become prone to avoiding them at all costs. If you are Mormon, this film offers absolutely nothing to be proud about.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, criticizing the film ""God's Army"" on multiple fronts. The reviewer expresses disappointment and frustration with the film's lack of universality, instead focusing on Mormon theology and catering solely to a Mormon audience. The director, Richard Dutcher, is criticized for his ineptitude as a filmmaker, with the reviewer finding his acting, script, and storytelling approach to be subpar. The cast's performances are also panned, with the reviewer suggesting that the script does not provide them with much to work with.

The reviewer is particularly upset with the film's handling of controversial aspects of the Mormon Church, such as its racist history, which is glossed over or framed in a sympathetic light. The reviewer argues that the film fails to address these issues in a meaningful way, instead relying on faith as a solution. The review also criticizes the film's tone, calling it ""syrupy"" and ""milktoast,"" and suggests that the film's attempts at humor are juvenile and unfunny.

Overall, the reviewer's tone is scathing, suggesting that the film is not only poorly made but also offensive and embarrassing to Mormons. The reviewer concludes that the film has no redeeming qualities, whether for non-Mormons or Mormons themselves.

6221,"Director / lead actor Dutcher revels in this look-at-me film, wherein he attempts to gain worldly acceptance for tarnishing the otherwise very upbeat world of Mormon missionaries. Some of the acting is fair. But some roles are unrealistic, i.e. the ominous (rather than fatherly) Mission President, etc. The film does give a fair look at how some missionaries may struggle with their faith, but the actual missionary program he claims to represent is far from his concept of it, in terms of being upbeat, cohesive, and inspired. The only inspiration I see in this film is Dutcher's self-inspiration. The film is slow and boring, and the shooting and screenplay look like a college student project.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is largely negative, criticizing the film's self-indulgent and inaccurate portrayal of Mormon missionaries. The reviewer accuses the director and lead actor, Dutcher, of seeking attention and validation through a film that misrepresents the missionary program.

While the film attempts to explore the struggles of missionaries with their faith, the reviewer argues that it fails to accurately represent the upbeat and cohesive nature of the actual missionary program.

The reviewer's tone is dismissive and critical, describing the film as ""slow and boring"" and likening it to a ""college student project"" in terms of its production quality.

The reviewer, a self-proclaimed long-time fan of Carlin, criticizes the comedian for abandoning his unique perspective and cleverness in favor of a straightforward, angry rant. The reviewer argues that Carlin's usual ability to present insightful and thought-provoking commentary is absent in this performance, replaced by a simplistic and unfunny list of grievances. The reviewer implies that the show appeals to a less discerning audience, lacking the intellectual depth and cleverness that Carlin is known for.

The reviewer's tone is one of disappointment and disillusionment, as they express their hope that Carlin's next show will return to the high standards they have come to expect from him. The criticism is not only about the lack of humor but also about the lack of intellectual depth and cleverness that Carlin is known for.

6223,"It is a movie which sheds the light on the begging of the Palestinian struggle against the Israeli occupation of Palestine but it does not show the real feelings of the people back then and how they were tricked into believing that they could return to their home soon , it does not mention the massacres committed by the Jews like Der Yassine and how they tortured and killed and destroyed the family of any Palestinian freedom fighter it lacks the credibility about the real Palestinian struggle and about anything Palestinian , however it has something about the suffering of Palestinian citizens ending up as refugees in the nearby Arab countries , the movie focuses on the story of the man in coma he is now in the present time and through his story we see the film . The movie is just telling the life of one person and has some nudity scenes which are irrelevant to the story.",Negative,Negative,Negative,negative,"This review is largely negative, criticizing the film for its inaccurate and incomplete portrayal of the Palestinian struggle against Israeli occupation. The reviewer argues that the film fails to convey the true emotions and experiences of the Palestinian people during that time, specifically omitting the brutal massacres and atrocities committed by the Israelis, such as the Der Yassine massacre. The reviewer also expresses disappointment that the film focuses on the story of a single individual, rather than providing a more comprehensive and credible representation of the Palestinian struggle.

The reviewer does acknowledge that the film touches on the suffering of Palestinian refugees in nearby Arab countries, but this is not enough to redeem the film's overall shortcomings. Additionally, the reviewer criticizes the inclusion of nudity scenes, which they deem irrelevant to the story. The tone of the review is one of disappointment and frustration, suggesting that the film had the potential to tell an important and powerful story but ultimately fell short.

6224,"Pepe le Moko, played by Charles Boyer, is some sort of international criminal mastermind wanted in countries throughout Europe, and to stay free he holes himself up in the Casbah, a mysterious part of Algiers where even the police are reluctant to go, until a senior officer is sent from Paris to capture le Moko once and for all. For le Moko, although the Casbah allows him to remain out of police custody, it also becomes a sort of prison at the same time - a place he can't leave, because the moment he does, he knows he'll be arrested.<br /><br />Boyer's performance was good, and I can understand why he was nominated for an Oscar. He captures the essence of such a character - a perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very classy at the same time. The movie itself, unfortunately, was quite a letdown. A number of parts of the story seemed inconsistent, of which I'll mention two. First was the idea that the police wouldn't enter the Casbah. That was stated pretty clearly at the beginning of the film by the local commander, and yet repeated references in the movie suggest that in fact the police did enter the Casbah fairly regularly. So, neither the suggestion by Commissioner Janvier that the police wouldn't enter, nor the statement by Inspector Slimane (also a decent performance by Joseph Calleia) that they could get into the Casbah but not out seemed to make much sense. I also found it difficult to believe that le Moko - hardened criminal mastermind that he was - could be so quickly swept off his feet by Gaby (Hedy Lamarr) to the point where he entertains the local populace by singing love songs and then leaves the Casbah to find her, essentially giving himself up. I understand the irony of the final few scenes, of course, as Pepe leaves the freedom of his prison (the Casbah) only to find real freedom in his capture (because he's shot and killed by the police.) I just found it impossible to believe that someone like le Moko would fall into such a trap.<br /><br />This is worth watching for Boyer, and to a lesser extent Calleia, but the story is disappointing and inconsistent. 3/10",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is mixed, but ultimately leans towards a negative assessment of the film. The reviewer praises Charles Boyer's performance as Pepe le Moko, stating that he captures the essence of the character and was deserving of his Oscar nomination. Additionally, Joseph Calleia's performance as Inspector Slimane is also commended. However, the reviewer expresses disappointment with the story, citing inconsistencies in the plot, particularly with regards to the police's ability to enter the Casbah. The reviewer also finds it hard to believe that the hardened criminal mastermind, Pepe le Moko, would fall so easily for Gaby and leave the Casbah, essentially giving himself up.

The reviewer's criticisms of the story and plot inconsistencies outweigh their praise for the performances, leading to an overall negative assessment of the film. The reviewer concludes that the film is only worth watching for Boyer's performance, but the story is disappointing and inconsistent, earning a low score of 3/10.

6225,"Algiers is not a classic, it is a perversion of the wonderful original Pepe le Moko, directed by Duvivier and starring a much more attractive and charming Pepe, Jean Gabin. If you want to fully experience the Casbah and the characters in Algiers, I recommend you don't even watch this movie and see Pepe le Moko instead, for it is much more elaborate, more beautifully filmed, the lines are not clichéd and the characters adhere much more to reality. Furthermore, the ending is so dramatic and key to Pepe's character that you'll find the Algiers version intolerable. Although Algiers does an almost excellent job mimicking each scene, the acting falls short as does the credibility of the characters. Plus, the wardrobe is truly breath-taking in all scenes, particularly Pepe's in the last scene and Gaby's (at all times) but also when she's on the boat. Frankly, Algiers is cheap as far as imitations go.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is highly critical of the film ""Algiers"", comparing it unfavorably to the original ""Pepe le Moko"". The reviewer argues that ""Algiers"" is a poor imitation, lacking the charm and charisma of the original's lead actor, Jean Gabin.

The reviewer also criticizes the acting and character credibility in ""Algiers"", stating that it is ""cheap"" and an inferior imitation.

The only positive comment made about ""Algiers"" is a brief mention of the impressive wardrobe, but this is not enough to redeem the film in the reviewer's eyes. The reviewer's tone is dismissive and disapproving, urging readers to avoid ""Algiers"" and instead watch the superior ""Pepe le Moko"".

6226,"Atmosphere and droll dialog don't redeem this overrated classic. Boyer is a French thief hiding in the Casbah of Algiers while the police try to figure out how to get him out. Meanwhile, he falls for Lamarr and tries to find a way to escape. The film is slow to get started and never really goes anywhere. Reminiscent of Casablanca in some ways, it's completely lacking any larger theme than the wanted man seducing a good woman. It's all talk-talk-talk, with endless scenes of Boyer swaggering among his idiot cohorts and Boyer wooing Lamarr in the shadows. Personally, I didn't care for Boyer's character for a minute, so the tension was utterly nonexistent.<br /><br />Stock 1930s character actors stumble thru the mushy plot as Boyer's henchmen--guys who clearly do not belong in Algiers. Sigrid Gurie is the wildly-overacting jealous girlfriend of Boyer. His brazen womanizing in front of her doesn't bode well for any future he might have with Lamarr.<br /><br />Especially bad is a long sequence in which an underling comes to tell Boyer how another henchman was captured. It sounds exciting... too bad we didn't see it for ourselves. The ending is completely anticlimactic and seems to be remarkable only because it is not a Hollywood happy ending; that doesn't stop it from being sappy.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is decidedly negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with the film. The reviewer argues that the film's atmosphere and dialogue, often cited as its strong points, are not enough to redeem its numerous flaws. The plot is criticized for being slow, meandering, and lacking in depth or larger themes, with the reviewer dismissing the central romance as unengaging and unconvincing. The characters are also panned, with the reviewer finding Boyer's character unlikable and the supporting cast, including Sigrid Gurie, to be over-the-top and unconvincing.

The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and dismissive, with phrases like ""talk-talk-talk"" and ""mushy plot"" conveying a sense of boredom and frustration.

But ultimately the plot, script and direction are flat as a pancake and as tired as a 90 year old nun after 180 ""Hail Mary""s.

6230,"Does anyone remember BRAVEHEART ? It starred Mel Gibson who also directed and was scripted by Randall Wallace . The film contains over 200 errors . Does anyone remember THE GREEN BERETS ? That`s the John Wayne western where the Duke saves a homestead called Vietnam from a bunch of injuns from the commie tribe . If you watch WE WERE SOLDIERS you can`t help but be reminded of these two films .<br /><br />First of all what`s with that Scottish lament that`s played three times in the movie , four if you count the end credits ? I mean what`s the connection between Scotland and `Nam ? Maybe Wallace is using it in the vain hope that because BRAVEHEART was bombarded - Undeservedly I might add - with several Oscars then so might this film ? Whatever reason it`s included it really jars . Gibson plays Hal Moore as a cross between William Wallace and John Wayne and I was expecting him to say something like "" They`ll never take our freedom - The hell they will "" and it`s impossible not to notice other similarities with THE GREEN BERETS like the subplot of a journalist picking up a gun and turning into a warrior and Moore telling the journalist about guilt in a scene almost identical to the one seen in the Wayne movie<br /><br />When not reminding the audience of other movies WWS also fails to stand on its own legs , it`s based on real events in 1965 but seems to lack an integrity needed to do the story justice , it never feels like 1965 and lacks a sense of time and place probably because it was filmed in America not Asia . Hal Moore might have brushed up on the French experience in Indo-China but if that`s the case then he was unique because the American military went out of their way not to read up on the French Indo-China war , indeed when asked about the previous conflict Westmoreland replied he had nothing to learn from the French "" Who haven`t won a war since the days of Napoleon "" so I was confused as to the portrayal of the NVA in this movie , when in 1965 the American high command , brimming with hubris held the North Vietnamese and VC in contempt . It`s like history has been rewritten in order to show the rice farmers of Vietnam are superlative warriors . They are , but very few Americans believed this in the mid 1960s<br /><br />There`s a couple of other things that confused me like how the wives back home get telegrams telling them their husbands are dead ? No bodies are shown being flown back to base and no one on screen is seen referring to who`s been killed in the La Drang valley . Likewise we`re not seen reinforcements arrive on screen so how do we suddenly see the Americans out number the NVA ? I put these down as directorial/ editing blunders on the part of Wallace who doesn`t strike me as much of a director , and his biggest problem seems to be communicating the horror of the battle . Take the scene where the American burned to a crisp is flown away screaming "" Tell my wife I love her "" . This should have an emotional impact similar to THAT death scene in PLATOON but here there`s no impact . In fact I found the scene cliched and patronising , and he`s not the only character to mouth the words "" Tell my wife ... "" while mutilated or dying , I counted at least two other characters use the phrase . Did characters actually say this at the battle ? I`ve no idea but since Randall Wallace wrote the script I do have reservations<br /><br />I sat in shocked awe watching APOCALYPSE NOW , PLATOON and THE KILLING FIELDS made my eyes water , I laughed at FULL METAL JACKET , I kept looking at my watch with THE DEER HUNTER , and after seeing WE WERE SOLDIERS I felt totally patronised",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with the film ""We Were Soldiers"". The reviewer begins by drawing comparisons to other films, such as ""Braveheart"" and ""The Green Berets"", implying that the film lacks originality and is trying to ride the coattails of more successful movies. The reviewer criticizes the inclusion of a Scottish lament, which they find jarring and unnecessary.

The reviewer also takes issue with the film's portrayal of historical events, suggesting that it lacks integrity and fails to accurately capture the time and place of the story. They question the depiction of the North Vietnamese Army and the American military's perception of them during the time period. The reviewer also points out inconsistencies and plot holes, such as the wives receiving telegrams about their husbands' deaths without any bodies being shown, and the sudden appearance of reinforcements.

The reviewer is also critical of the film's direction, suggesting that Randall Wallace is not a skilled director and fails to convey the horror of the battle effectively. They find certain scenes, such as the burned soldier's death, to be clichéd and patronizing.

Throughout the review, the tone is one of disappointment and frustration, with the reviewer expressing a sense of being patronized by the film. The reviewer's negative opinion is reinforced by their comparison to other, more impactful war films, which they found to be more effective in conveying the emotional impact of war.

6231,"So many people have taken shots at Platoon and Born On the Fourth of July among other calling them ""leftist propaganda film."" Now its my turn to take a political shot at a movie. To me this movie is very imposing on certain religious beliefs and on its political views.<br /><br />The acting and writing was a little to clichéd for my liking. Mel Gibson seems to like to play in these unnecessary violent films and proves it once again by teaming up with his partner Randall Wallace for yet another one. Throughout this movie there was this garbage prototypical ""Just tell my family I love them"" or ""Tell Ronny to pray before hoe goes to bed"" lines. The was so overloaded with this garbage retread lines that I felt like I had to vomit. How about that scene were Gibson's wife goes to do her laundry and this ""no colors"" applies to what to put in the washing machine. Its in the mid-sixties was she some how stuck under a rock not noticing the racism around her. Another scene is were Gibson's daughter asks him what war is and the scene is shot in such a trivial matter.<br /><br />The directing displayed this all perfectly. The countless scenes of Gibson and his family or soldiers praying. I'm fine with showing that once or twice but after a while I wonder if the movie is trying to shove something into my head. How many scenes with the American flag at its finest hour were shot with the melodramatic music on. The director also makes it seem like we won some sort of victory in Vietnam. What exactly was won their. The cinematography was the worst of it with the slowed down scenes see the American flag in the distance scenes spread throughout. I love America but movies like this seem to glorify every little thing we do.<br /><br />This may seem like a rant and maybe it is but I cannot stand it when a movie like this makes people who are not religious are not so patriotic that they will agree with anything their country does look bad. This movie to me is narrow minded and limited in so many aspects. To me it says if your not Christian your wrong. Would God or Jesus want people to kill I don't think so. To me this movie was offensive. At first this movie was funny with the countless clichés and overacted scenes but then when I looked at what this movie was trying to say or not say it was really frustrating to watch. I guess though it is my fault that I chose to watch this movie. I hope no one takes this comment offensively because I am not criticizing religion or patriotism but some of the narrow minded people who are so into both and discount everyone else.<br /><br />If you want a real depiction of the Vietnam war watch Platoon, Born On the Fourth of July, Apocalypse Now, The Deer Hunter or The Killing Fields. Even Full Metal Jacket which I absolutely hated was a better depiction.

6232,"I've read all the complimentary posts on this muddled semi-noir and am puzzled at the high regard for what seems, in the cruel light of 2007, a very sloppy late-RKO assembly-line product. All that endless documentary footage of fish, waves, fish, waves has little to do with the central conflict and just pads the running time. The editing is downright careless: Scenes just end, and are followed by other scenes that have little to do with what preceded them. The dialog bears the stilted traces of the Odets origins: high-flown metaphors that never could have come from the limited imaginations of these workaday people. But what's really surprising is how horribly overacted the triangle is, on all sides. I love Stanwyck, but she snarls and contorts and lashes out wildly -- an undisciplined performance several notches below her standard. Douglas, overplaying at being lovable, then goes onto a would-be murderous rampage and is similarly hammy, as is Ryan, snarling and shouting most unnaturally. The less interesting second couple at least provides recognizable human behavior: Keith Andes, whose character is kind of a Neanderthal by today's standards, nevertheless is smooth and persuasive as Stanwyck's (much younger, one presumes) brother, and Marilyn Monroe, as his girlfriend, is natural and unaffected. On Monterey's windswept coast (and all that Monterey footage, while largely irrelevant, is interesting as a document of what the town looked like), amid all the overheated hysteria, these two are islands of sanity. A final point, and a spoiler: Perhaps the Breen Office mandated it, but does anybody believe the happy ending for a second?

6234,"Ok, so I saw this movie at this year's Sundance, and I was sorely unimpressed. It took a good fifteen minutes of footage before there was an edit or a line of dialogue that made any sense, and it took another 30 minutes before the ham-fisted script gave way to a working plot that wasn't contingent on a close-up of Ryan Gosling's smile or contrived moralizing. After the first 45 minutes however, the script blossomed into a watch-able albeit not completely entertaining or thought-provoking. The highlights certainly include both Gosling and Morse's acting, Gosling being an up-and-coming star, and Morse being an extremely well-established character actor with a good feel for disparate emotions. As a sidenote, after the screening I was talking a little smack about the movie to some of my friends when David Morse walked right behind me--He looks like the nicest guy in the world, but he's a solid 6'2"" and probably outweighs me by 50 pounds.

However, the reviewer does acknowledge that the film improves after the initial slow start, becoming ""watchable"" but not particularly entertaining or thought-provoking.

6236,"So, as far as I gather, this episode is trying to make a statement about how real-life villains are very bad people, and this is just as scary as the paranormal. The ""paranormal"" imagery associated with the villain, Donnie, is purely symbolic. He's actually just a normal human being.<br /><br />The problem is that I just don't buy it. Donnie is simply not scarier than the paranormal. He's not even that scary at all. As a guy who seems confused and weird rather than malicious, likes dead girls and hair, and has only newly become a murderer, he's significantly less disturbing than most well-known real-life serial killers (eg: he's like a VERY watered-down version of Ed Gein). Which is why Scully's horror at seeing nothing but bodies with hair and nails cut off (something not too different from a normal personal hygiene routine), before anybody has even been killed or hurt at all, is completely out of character.

I think without the character of Richie Nix, it might have been alright - although he is the reason the story line takes the course it does.

6239,"Following the whirlwind success of The Wrestler (see my review), Mickey Rourke had this ""gem"" head straight to video. Every copy was rented for months and I even heard some good buzz around it. So months later I caught it on a movie network and sat down to watch it. First of all...one of the locations in the film (Walpole Island) is a place I used to visit on a regular basis as a child because we lived very, very close to the reserve. Cool huh? That's about where the coolness ends with this dud. I mean the story is decent enough to warrant a four and even the direction is not bad but the performances are just awful, and downright ridiculous with some truly wasted star power and Mickey $%#@*&! Rourke playing a Native Canadian/American hit-man?!?! What in the Lord's name were they thinking?? He doesn't even resemble Native blood and his attempt at the generic Native accent made him look even more ridiculous. They could have went anywhere with this story...they could have hired a Native actor, or changed Rourke's character, how about a white man raised by Native parents? Instead they made Killshot a complete and utter joke.<br /><br />As you may have caught Mickey Rourke ""stars"" in Killshot, I use that term loosely. I have never liked Rourke much although his Oscar winning performance was decent enough. This shows and confirms my dislike for him. He looks bored, constantly bored, and his lame attempt at portraying a Native is bordering on insulting I would think. He makes a decent cold blooded killer but then the story never explores that part of him which is totally backwards to the story. Diane Lane, although well respected in Hollywood, turns in another drab performance. She has had her moments but overall she just usually doesn't take off in any one performance. She looks like she is going to be great but then when she isn't, its even more disappointing. Thomas Jane plays her protective husband. I've always felt Jane deserves a bigger career than he has. I think he's got action star in his blood. All said and done his performance in Killshot is actually not bad. He doesn't take things too far and he's tough and almost heroic in a way. Him and Lane manage to have decent chemistry but he doesn't get a lot in the way of his character. I have absolutely NO idea why Rosario Dawson A) did this movie and B) had a character at all. Her character is absolutely useless and had no point to the plot or story making any performance she would give equally as bad. I have rarely seen a character who is supporting so incredibly useless. The only redeeming character and performance in this film is that given by Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the deranged mini killer who wants to team up with Rourke's hit-man. Gordon-Levitt is over the top crazy and entertaining and his character is actually engaging. If this film had been entirely about him it would have been a smash. He literally saves this from utter crap. His performance is almost worth watching this drivel for.<br /><br />Oscar nominated director...whoa wait? Yes Oscar nominated director John Madden (I think the football coach could have done a better job) helms this mess. I have actually never seen Shakespeare In Love, but I remember the critical acclaim it received and it surprised me because the direction in this film and with the characters was downright awful. Screenplay writer Hossein Amini has done nothing I recognize but apparently has been slated to write the next Jack Ryan movie and after this mess I can't even imagine why they'd want him. I understand this is based on a novel and I really hope the novel is worlds above this mess. A little bit of action and some sort of hokey attempt at an emotionally charged story of a hit-man and his partner and the mess they get involved in. Unfortunately unless you're a HUGE Rourke fan or really love Joseph Gordon-Levitt then there is no reason to put yourself through this pain.

6240,"There are many distinct problems with the movie ""KillShot"". For one, there are way too many coincidences. The husband is a hunter and just happens to be hunting on the day that the main killer shows up, with someone the killer knows. Okay I will take that one. The kid calls the real estate agency that the wife works for and asks for money to be ready when he comes to get it. Okay, I will take that one as well. Before he goes to get the cash he decided to rob our killer, who doesn't kill him but decided to go with him on the job. It's starting to get real weak. Then they show up, on the same day that the husband has an interview with his wives boss. No one is there but the wife and the husband who has decided to make his way into the empty office. They make their way into the office and the professional killer just assumes that they are talking to the right guy. That is just in the first 15 minuets.<br /><br />There are a lot more holes in this movie then I care to talk about. Why the killer didn't just kill everyone at the real estate agency I don't know. Why he didn't shoot the woman on her porch, I don't know. Why he kept letting that dumb kid make all those stupid moves and mess a whole lot of crap up, I don't know. Why the girlfriend was even in the movie, I don't know. Why he decided not to pocket the gun and just leave it out on the counter, I don't know. Why they even went into the witness protection program, I don't know. What I do know is that the Casting Director did a great job, the Director of Photography did very good work, the Location Scout picked great locations, and the Production Designer was worth every penny. So my advice for anyone that is going to pick a script that is going to be so well worked by the crew, make sure that every attempt to kill someone by the hit man is not foiled by a peak through an open window.",Negative,Negative,Negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer listing numerous criticisms of the movie ""KillShot"".

6241,"Ugh. Even the ever-popular Diane Lane could not save this movie, and the most exciting thing about the movie was seeing if Rourke's face would move. One has heard so much ""gossip"" about his botched face lift, etc., so like an accident on the side of the road, we just had to slow down and see the wreck. The plot was thin. Here we have a very professional mob hit man who somehow latches on to a wild and uncontrollable punk/crook, and throughout this movie we're wondering why this guy stays with this idiot, let alone gets together with the guy in the first place. Then the crime that was not even committed has the pro to go after the witnesses. He would have popped them right then and there. But then, we would not have had a movie then, would we? And why did the realtor even agree to the extortion? There were more holes in this flick than in my colander. The acting was horrid, the entire movie predictable down to the minute, and even the ending. And so much could have been done to make this a much better movie.

6242,"Truly appalling waste of space. Me and my friend tried to watch this film to its conclusion but had to switch it off about 30 minutes from the end. And i can count the films I have switched off before the end on one hand.<br /><br />The script and direction are leaden and deeply uninspiring. I wouldn't be surprised if they found the script in a pile of cast off scripts from 1983. For example the irritating scroat threatening the real estate guy from his house phone. I mean seriously. The police would be beating his door down in minutes. The scenes and events just wash by you like turds in a river. It is difficult to understand the actual thrust of the film. The narrative flicks between characters in a seemingly random manner breaking up the pathetic attempts at building the characters. Oh and what ""characters"" they are. The protagonist played by Rourke is dreadful. He could have just sent a cardboard cut out of himself and stayed in bed. After 60 or so minutes of the film I had built absolutely zero attachment to this character. He is neither sympathetic nor hateful. Just a disfigured dummy from a shop window blundering through every single scene. His motivation is impossible to discern from his generally mumbled and emotionless delivery. Is he happy? Is he sad? Angry? No idea. Just those same dead eyes staring out at you from a disfigured chunk of flesh. And the native American theme is just awful and pointless.<br /><br />The good guys are at best unlikeable. A dull white collar stereotype and a simpering neurotic ex-wife stereotype. Cue archetypal wife with shotgun face off with bad guy, ""you aren't going to shoot me"" that is both tiresomely unoriginal and annoying.<br /><br />The richie nix character seems interesting at first but soon descends into an irritating one sided psycho character. Which seems at odds with the seeming intention of making the bad guys in some way sympathetic or at least realistically motivated.<br /><br />Roasario Dawsons character starts with some promise but soon descends into a sickening and childlike parody of the gangsters chick scenes from Jackie Brown. You really want me to believe her character was SO attracted to Rourke's? Or worse she is just a floozy who sleeps with anything that moves? Realistic female characters FTW! <br /><br />In summary a complete mess of a film. Hopeless characterisations and performances. A leaden and hackneyed script along with uninspired direction. And ultimately extremely dull. Its not even comedy bad either. Laughing at Rourkes haggard face gets pretty old after sitting through the first 15 turgid minutes of the film.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is extremely negative, with the reviewer expressing their utter disdain for the film.

6243,"I decided to watch this movie in order to fall asleep. It kept me awake, so it was interesting; however, it was pretty bland.<br /><br />The acting was good. I don't think any of the actors did a bad job. Mickey Rourke is as believable as an over-the-hill hit-man can be. The dialogue in this movie does not provide much opportunity for these actors to show off their full potential, but they still shined.<br /><br />The atmosphere was great. Music was good and colors matched the mood that the director wanted to paint for the viewers. Even the weather enhanced the mood of the movie. Everything was well done.<br /><br />The failures of this movie are in its story development. The storyline with the mafia vs. Blackbird doesn't get enough attention. The storyline for Carmen and Wayne's divorce doesn't get explained. The FBI seems to work extra fast here. Is there no paperwork for all these processes? Is it really that easy to dig up your brother's body from his grave, burn the corpse, and have it be identified as you? There are too many loops in the storyline for me to give this movie anything higher than a 4 out of 10 rating. I wouldn't recommend this movie to people unless they're really bored and have smoked some really good weed. Even if WoW is down for maintenance, go find something better to do than watch this movie.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is mixed, but ultimately leans towards a negative assessment of the film. The reviewer starts by mentioning that the movie kept them awake, implying that it was somewhat engaging, but then proceeds to criticize various aspects of the film. The acting is praised, with the reviewer acknowledging that the actors did a good job despite the limitations of the dialogue. The atmosphere, music, and visuals are also commended for effectively setting the mood.

However, the reviewer's main criticisms lie in the story development, which they find lacking. The plotlines involving the mafia, the divorce, and the FBI are deemed underdeveloped, and the reviewer questions the plausibility of certain events in the film. The reviewer's tone becomes increasingly sarcastic, implying that the movie is not worth watching unless one is extremely bored or under the influence of substances.

The reviewer's final rating of 4 out of 10 and their dismissive tone towards the film suggest that the negative aspects outweigh the positive ones. While they acknowledge some redeeming qualities, the reviewer's overall assessment is that the movie is not worth recommending.

6245,"Mickey Rourke hunts Diane Lane in Elmore Leonard's Killshot It is not like Mickey Rourke ever really disappeared. He has had a steady string of appearances before he burst back on the scene. He was memorable in: Domino, Sin City, Man on Fire, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, and Get Carter. But in his powerful dramatic performance in The Wrestler (2008), we see a full blown presentation of the character only hinted at in Get Carter. Whenever we get to know him, Rourke remains a cool, but sleazy, muscle bound slim ball.<br /><br />This is an Elmore Leonard story, and production. Leonard wrote such notable movies as taunt western thriller 3:10 to Yuma, Be Cool, Jackie Brown, Get Shorty, 52 Pick-Up, and Joe Kidd. This means that we get tough guys, some good, some not so good.<br /><br />It also means we get tight, realistic plots with characters doing what is best for them in each situation, weaving complications into violent conclusions. Killshot is no different. Tough, slim ball killer Rourke stalks unhappily married witness Lane. Think History of Violence meets No Country for Old Men. It is not as intense, bloody or gory as those two, but it is almost as good. If you like those two, including David Croneberg's equally wonderful Eastern Promises, you will like Killshot also.<br /><br />Director John Madden has not done a lot of movies. His last few were enjoyable, if not successful: Proof, Captain Corelli's Mandolin and Shakespeare in Love.<br /><br />Diana Lane hasn't had a powerful movie role since she and Richard Gere gave incredible performances in Unfaithful. Lately she is charming and appealing in romantic stories such as Nights in Rodanthe, Must Love Dogs, and Under the Tuscan Sun. Here she is right on mark, balancing her sexy appeal with reserved tension.<br /><br />This is a small part for Rosario Dawson. Yet Dawson does a good job with it. You see a lot more of Lane, including an underwear scene to rival Sigourney Weaver in Aliens and Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shut.<br /><br />While you are in the crime drama section, also pick up Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang, and Gone Baby Gone, and Before the Devil Knows Your Dead. The last has wonderful performances by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney.<br /><br />Killshot flopped at the box office. More is our luck.

6249,"Based on the Elmore Leonard novel of the same name, Killshot suffers from a lack of focus, direction, and creativity  all elements which the original story likely had, and negative test screenings forced severe edits, (including the complete excising of a character) resulting in a film that feels almost nothing like a Leonard story. Far too many characters populate a storyline too simplistic and straightforward (not a typical trait of the author's work) and the focus continually switches between two hit men who are difficult to like and a troubled couple who don't command our sympathy. While the story itself provides precious few twists and turns, sadly by the end of the film its appeal still remains a mystery. <br /><br />Washed-up hit-man Armand ""The Blackbird"" Degas (Mickey Rourke) follows a strict code during his missions that inadvertently sours his latest assignment. Now on the run from his former employer, he haphazardly joins forces with inept misfit criminal Richie Nix (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) to gain some quick cash by extorting a wealthy realtor. When struggling couple Carmen and Wayne Colson (Diane Lane and Thomas Jane) are privy to the thieves' blundered plot, they are forced into hiding as the crazed killers will stop at nothing to silence the two witnesses. <br /><br />Killshot proves that being based on an Elmore Leonard novel isn't grounds for immediate success or even a promising adaptation. The characters, situations, and even resolutions in the film are all tired and unoriginal and only very randomly hint at something more. It's not that there wasn't potential, especially when Rourke's black-garbed, calm and collected assassin perfectly executes a hit during the opening scene  purpose and principals are just continually abandoned as each minute ticks away. The style and manner in which each character is introduced is the most intriguing; visually the roles of Bird and even Wayne are fleshed out befittingly, giving immediate interest and depth to personas that typically end in a creative impasse.<br /><br />The pairing of the cold and calculating Black Bird with the irrational and explosive Richie is an enticing combination (comparisons to Fargo would be extravagantly too kind), except that each character seems to slowly lose track of the traits that kept them initially interesting. As Richie starts picking up the more experienced killer's habits, Bird loosens his grip on his own methods of murder. Regardless of what he sees in his momentary lighthearted fling with Donna (Rosario Dawson), it's hard to imagine that his final confrontation with panicky Carmen would provoke a confession of his true nature and subsequent carelessness that drastically affects his outcome. Likely or not, this is Killshot's unfortunate downfall  and little entertainment can be garnered from these characters who steadily lose their originality by continually contradicting the habits that once made them intriguing. <br /><br />- The Massie Twins",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, criticizing the film ""Killshot"" for its lack of focus, direction, and creativity. The reviewer argues that the film fails to capture the essence of Elmore Leonard's novel, with a simplistic and straightforward storyline that lacks twists and turns.

The reviewer also criticizes the film's inability to maintain the initial intrigue of its characters, with their traits and habits being abandoned as the story progresses.

The review highlights the wasted potential of the film, particularly in its failure to capitalize on the interesting pairing of the cold and calculating Black Bird with the irrational and explosive Richie.

But both don't go together, because the kid he tries to guide poses him in dangerous situations where no professional killer would put himself. Now, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is a good looking actor, but he played his character a little unnatural. I didn't believe his acting, it looked like the director tried to pull out of him some personality he couldn't provide. And he didn't have to, because his less crazy behavior was creepy enough.

When you do get an explanation, it doesn't fit the story that went before it. What it does is bore you. For all the acting talent in the film, it just isn't interesting.

For some reason, this comes as an earth-shattering reveal for her, despite the fact that she always commented on her husband's American accent. Also, their son - remember, he was born in France and never knew his father was American - speaks perfect American English without a hint of French accent. That's just one of several huge plot holes in this movie.<br /><br />The main bulk of the movie is a flashback to Tommy's youth in New York City during the 1970's, as he explains to his wife why he has been hiding in France. His best friend as a boy was Pappas, a retarded adult played terribly by Robin Williams. I assume Duchovny thinks that ""retarded"" is someone who is just sort of dumb, because Pappas comes off only mildly slow at times, while other times he comes off as just Robin Williams. Yes, Williams actually fits in his tired improv schtick although he is supposed to play a person who is mentally slow.<br /><br />Tommy's mother, played by Duchovny's wife Tea Leoni, is a pill-popping nurse who is distraught over the recent death of her husband. Leoni does a good job, but she mainly just smokes a lot and yells at Tommy for things that don't seem to be too important. The script didn't give her much to work with. Tommy also befriends a lady (whom he calls ""Lady"") who is in prison and offers him advice through her jail window (this house of detention is called ""House of D"" for short, thus the title). Tommy has no qualms yelling his personal problems out loud on a city street so this incarcerated felon can offer him advice, and he does so many times without care.<br /><br />I don't want to bore you with the entire summary of the movie, but plot holes are abound in this film that tries way too hard to be touching but comes off as, well, bad. Real bad. Real real bad. Near the end of this train wreck, the script gets cornier and cornier and ends with a laughably crappy ending.<br /><br />Critics tore ""House of D"" apart and rightfully so. I can't believe some people actually like this movie. It is a painful film to sit through and I felt weak afterwards - not from emotion, but from how terrible it was.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is extremely negative, with the reviewer expressing their utter disdain for the film ""House of D"". The reviewer starts by mentioning that the script was written in just six days, implying that the film's poor quality is a result of rushed and careless writing. The reviewer then proceeds to list numerous criticisms, including plot holes, poor character development, and unrealistic dialogue. The reviewer specifically targets the performances of Robin Williams and Tea Leoni, suggesting that they were underutilized and given poor material to work with.

The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and dismissive, with phrases like ""real bad"", ""real real bad"", and ""laughably crappy ending"" emphasizing their contempt for the film. The reviewer also expresses disbelief that some people might actually enjoy the movie, implying that anyone who likes it must have poor taste. The review concludes by stating that the film is ""painful to sit through"" and left the reviewer feeling ""weak"" due to its terrible quality.

6254,"This is a movie with a wonderful concept, but very weak writing. It should never have been released with out at least three more re-writes (assuming it got any). The story is too loosly held together, and there are too many 90 degree turns in the story to make it a cohesive movie. It would be great to see what a decent screen-writer could do with the story.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is decidedly negative, criticizing the film's writing as ""very weak"" and suggesting that it was released prematurely without sufficient rewrites. The reviewer argues that the story lacks cohesion, with too many abrupt plot twists that disrupt the narrative flow. The tone is one of disappointment and frustration, implying that the film's concept had potential but was squandered due to poor execution.

The reviewer's criticism is not limited to the story's structure, but also extends to the writing itself, implying that a more skilled screenwriter could have done justice to the concept. The use of phrases like ""loosely held together"" and ""90 degree turns"" emphasizes the reviewer's perception of the film's narrative as disjointed and poorly constructed.

Overall, the review expresses a sense of wasted potential, with the reviewer lamenting what could have been if the script had received more attention and refinement.

The only neat thing about this movie are the electric planes. Aside from that prepare for some sweet zzzzz's.

Now, if you will excuse me, I will finish my nap.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing their disappointment and boredom with the movie. The tone is sarcastic, with the reviewer suggesting that the movie is so dull that it could be used as a sleep aid. The only positive comment made is about the electric planes, but this is not enough to redeem the rest of the film. The reviewer is shocked that big-name stars are involved in such a dull movie, implying that they expected more from the cast. The review ends with the reviewer jokingly saying they need to finish their nap, further emphasizing their lack of engagement with the movie.

6256,"This movie was strange mainly because the plot was so incoherent. The title refers to a vicious wind which renders the surface of the earth almost uninhabitable when it blows, but this seemed to have nothing whatsoever to do with what was going on. The movie seems to be an extremely poor rip-off of Bladerunner ie rogue android being chased by bounty hunter(or ruthless cop in this). Luke Skywalker turns in a surprisingly good performance as afore-mentioned rogue cop. Nothing seems to be resolved at the end of the movie, we never find out anything of any substance about the android or what his intentions are. There is one baffling scene where Bill Paxton(who has kidnapped the android) plays one particular song in his cardboard airplane for no particular reason(the song is called ""Shape of things"", by The Yardbirds). This happens again in a later scene where the same song is played for no apparent reason. Does this song have any relevance to the movie? Don't think so.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, criticizing the film's incoherent plot, lack of resolution, and seemingly irrelevant scenes. The reviewer expresses confusion about the title, ""Windwalker,"" which appears to have no connection to the storyline. The film is also accused of being a poor rip-off of ""Bladerunner,"" with a similar plot involving a rogue android and a bounty hunter. While the reviewer praises Mark Hamill's (Luke Skywalker) performance as the rogue cop, this is not enough to redeem the film's numerous shortcomings.

The review highlights several baffling scenes, including one where Bill Paxton plays a song, ""Shape of Things,"" in a cardboard airplane, with no apparent relevance to the plot. This scene is mentioned twice, emphasizing the reviewer's frustration with the film's lack of coherence. The reviewer's tone is one of disappointment and confusion, with a sense of bewilderment at the film's failure to provide meaningful answers or resolution.

6257,"This film fails on many many levels. The script is the first failing, and as I understand it, if the script stinks, there's nothing that can fix that. The plot is boring, after the first 45 minutes, I'm looking at the counter on the DVD saying to myself, ""how much longer?"" The cinematography is pretty awful. I'm not sure how bad the transfer was to DVD, but it looked like a VHS copy. Also, the sound was bad. I realize this isn't going to get remixed for 5.1, but yikes, it didn't even sound like it was in Dolby Stereo which had been around for almost a decade when they cut this film.<br /><br />Slipstream was far too similar to both Mad Max and Blade Runner for comfort. Because of the lack of decent special effects and high quality dialog, it is extremely disappointing. If I recall, the pointer scene took place during the last 20 minutes, usually it should take place in the first 20. Most people will be totally confused as to what the heck is going on until the final 20 minutes.<br /><br />The film's music was excellent in parts, and then completely inappropriate in others. Elmer Bernstien did the scoring, but it sounds like someone else had a hand in sticking in 'other' stuff elsewhere as it doesn't match the overall good orchestral score (with some synthesizer music.)<br /><br />There were great actors cast, Bob Peck, Mark Hamill, Ben Kingsley, Bill Paxton. And they did a great job breathing the little available life into their characters. (Well, Paxton's character was pretty stupid, and the whole movie was centered on him. I'm not sure a heroic stooge is a good choice for the main character who carries the film.) Again, a major flaw with the script.<br /><br />Thank goodness I watched this from a mail order DVD service, and not the theater. Overall a major disappointment for Sci-fi fans, or fans of Paxton, or Hamill. 90 minutes of your life, you'll never get back.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with various aspects of the film. The script is deemed the primary failure, with a boring plot that fails to engage the audience. The cinematography is also criticized for its poor quality, resembling a VHS copy, and the sound design is panned for its subpar quality. The reviewer notes that the film's similarities to Mad Max and Blade Runner are too great, and the lack of decent special effects and dialogue only adds to the disappointment.

The reviewer does acknowledge that the film's music is excellent in parts, but inconsistent and sometimes inappropriate. The cast, which includes notable actors like Bob Peck, Mark Hamill, Ben Kingsley, and Bill Paxton, is praised for their efforts to bring life to their characters, despite the script's limitations. However, the reviewer questions the choice of Paxton's character as the main protagonist, citing it as another flaw in the script.

The review concludes by stating that the film is a major disappointment for sci-fi fans, fans of the cast, and anyone who invests 90 minutes of their time. The tone is scathing, with the reviewer implying that the film is a waste of time.

Answer: Negative"
6258,"The story and the characters really REALLY needed work. The world idea is kind of neat, but no one bothered to develop any of it either through exposition, or through the plot. Despite the cheesy notes at the beginning of the film, it makes sense that you wouldn't use exposition, since no one is new to this world. And yet, when Matt Owens (Bill Paxton) and Byron (Bob Peck) stray off-course and get lost, and get introduced to the wind-worshipers and the fat, lazy, rich people in the museum, we don't get any real idea of who these people are, or why we should care about any of them. Smart films have ways of developing this simply by having the characters live in the world. Simple things, like ordering a drink at a bar, or talking about something in the past -- these are the kind of things that make the film world memorable, not endless shots of crappy planes, and cheap CG effects of someone trying to do loops in an ultralight.<br /><br />If this is too difficult for you, here's a little tip -- pare down the multiple locations. If everything's becoming disjointed because you're pulling up to often, stay in one place for a little while and have the characters talk a little. All the superfluous crap should be removed. Get rid of the entire wind-worshipers scene. Get rid of the stuffy museum people. Get rid of all the crappy flying crap unless you can make the wind relevant to the story. Have the entire thing set on a big plane, or something. Just get people talking about something we care about.<br /><br />Hey, get rid of Bill Paxton. Have the film center around Tasker's character and his relationship with the robot, Byron.<br /><br />Indeed, the biggest problem of the film is that we don't care anything about anybody, because no one takes the time to either explain their motivations or delve into their characters. We don't like Matt (well, because he's played by Bill Paxton, among other things). He's a scoundrel, who doesn't redeem himself enough, except to let the android, Byron, go. And this action has even less meaning than most because of three key points: <br /><br />1. Byron is a murderer. 2. Byron is indestructible 3. Byron can leave any time he damn well pleases.<br /><br />We try to like Byron, because there's a kind of pathos there, but it's largely undeveloped. All we're left with is a whiny, glassy-eyed robot guy who's acting is subdued and wooden one moment, and practically zany the next. We don't know why or how he develops emotions, but we do know for a fact that he's murdered someone. We don't know why he murdered someone, or the circumstances of this grisly event, because it isn't developed. We can't feel pity for him if we don't know the story. All we know for a fact is that he murders people. And he likes Bill Paxton.<br /><br />We don't hate Tasker enough (partly because he's played by good-guy Mark Hamill), since while gruff and ruthless, doesn't do anything out of the ordinary for his character -- a post-apocalyptic peace officer. Sure he kills Montclaire (Robbie Coltrane) and his team, but they are drug dealers, on their way to grow poppies for heroin. And they shoot at him first. He doesn't kill anyone who doesn't get in the way, or who does not try to physically harm him first. That goes equally well for the final confrontation in the museum. He uses a smidge of police brutality against a lazy dilettante (F. Murray Abraham is wasted in this role), and everyone else draws a gun on him.<br /><br />I really don't understand what's the deal with Belitski (Kitty Aldridge), Tasker's partner. After only an accumulated 10 minutes with Matt, she's ready to switch sides, despite her shouts of loyalty, and despite Matt's trash-talking her, and punching her out. If that's love, then I'll choose hate any day.<br /><br />Really. Paxton's character is about as lovable as Simon in ""True Lies"", or Pvt. Hudson from ""Aliens"". Does anyone fall for him in these movies? No. Why? Because he's a loud-mouthed idiot, and a loser. Why put him at the helm of this film?",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing frustration and disappointment with almost every aspect of the film. The reviewer criticizes the story, characters, and world-building, stating that the film fails to develop its characters, plot, and world in a meaningful way. The reviewer argues that the film's attempts at world-building are shallow and lack exposition, making it difficult for the audience to care about the characters or their motivations.

The reviewer also expresses disappointment with the film's characters, particularly Matt Owens, played by Bill Paxton, who is portrayed as a scoundrel without redemption. The reviewer suggests that the film would be improved by focusing on Tasker's character and his relationship with the robot, Byron, rather than Matt Owens. The reviewer also criticizes the film's pacing, suggesting that the multiple locations and plot threads make the film feel disjointed and confusing.

The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and critical, with a sense of exasperation and frustration. The reviewer's suggestions for improvement, such as paring down the multiple locations and focusing on character development, are presented as obvious and necessary fixes for the film's many problems.

6259,"The quote above just about says it all for ""Slipstream"". I should have bailed out of this film after the first half hour, but decided I ought to be fair and give it a chance. I won't watch it again, so if anyone with the temerity to do so can get back to me with the number of clichéd lines in the movie, I'm sure it will set a record.<br /><br />Some otherwise fine and talented actors got mixed up with this clunker; Mark Hamill portrays a futuristic bounty hunter and Bill Paxton is his quarry. Paxton's character has hijacked Hamill's prisoner, an android taking his name from the poet Byron (Bob Peck). Tasker (Hamill) shoots Owens (Paxton) with a dart containing a tracking device so he and his companion Belitski (Kitty Aldridge) can keep tabs on the pair. The real question though is why didn't he just fire the device at Byron thereby cutting out the middleman.<br /><br />If you enjoy scene after disjointed scene with tedious characterization and artsy fartsy pretense, then I suppose you'll find something of interest here. But you can't convince me that the film makes sense on any level. Scenes of a futuristic Stone Age make way for high society snobbery, but the pinnacle of poor taste is reached when Paxton's character is displayed following a night of revelry with hickeys all over his torso. If anyone thinks there's some hidden meaning here, you're really stretching.<br /><br />Patiently waiting for the frame proclaiming ""The End"" to come into view, alas, even that was denied. If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, then so is understanding; this movie had neither. Yet there was a single redeeming feature as the closing credits began their run - an awesome view of a half dozen hot air balloons. Apparently the film was keeping them afloat.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing frustration and disappointment with the film ""Slipstream"". The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and critical, implying that the film is a ""clunker"" with too many clichéd lines. The reviewer questions the plot decisions, character motivations, and overall coherence of the film, suggesting that it ""doesn't make sense on any level"". The reviewer also mocks the film's attempts at being ""artsy"" and ""pretentious"", implying that they are shallow and lacking in substance.

The reviewer's criticism extends to the film's pacing, character development, and even the inclusion of certain scenes, which they deem unnecessary and gratuitous. The only positive comment made is about the closing credits, which feature a visually appealing shot of hot air balloons. However, this is not enough to redeem the film in the reviewer's eyes.

6260,"Combine good casting, bad writing, good orchestral scoring, bad dialogue, and good story idea with lots of potential but is never realized then you have Slipstream. <br /><br />Just bought the movie for a buck, it is worth it, but not much more. <br /><br />Good to see Mark Hamill act again. <br /><br />There should be a decent sequel made to remedy the damage from the original. Or at least give it the proper attention it should have received in the first place. <br /><br />Berstein's score gave demanded your attention from the opening credits, however, the long shots of slipstream planes and the even longer revealing of interesting plot points mutes his attention getting score. <br /><br />It is really easy to dog a movie like this, after all it is by the producer of STARWARS and the director of TRON and a tremendous cast but it is what it is. And that ain't much.<br /><br />Favorite Line- ""We're going to make it, ha-ha!...(BOOM!)""",Negative,Negative,Negative,negative,"This review is predominantly negative, despite acknowledging some positive aspects of the film ""Slipstream"". The reviewer criticizes the writing, dialogue, and overall execution of the movie, stating that it fails to realize its potential. The reviewer mentions that the film's good casting, including Mark Hamill, is overshadowed by the poor writing and dialogue. The score by Bernstein is praised, but even that is not enough to redeem the film's shortcomings.

The reviewer's tone is somewhat sarcastic, implying that the film's connections to notable franchises like Star Wars and TRON should have resulted in a better product. The reviewer's comment that the film is ""worth a buck"" suggests that it's not worth much more than that. The inclusion of a ""favorite line"" from the movie comes across as somewhat ironic, as it's followed by a sarcastic ""(BOOM!)"" that implies the line is more memorable for its cheesiness than its quality.

Despite the negative tone, the reviewer does express a desire for a sequel or remake that could potentially redeem the original's shortcomings. However, this sentiment is not enough to outweigh the overall negative assessment of the film.

6261,"Yeeee-Haa! <br /><br />I have seen it argued that most American Movies are cowboy movies in disguise; that Hollywood is so in love with it's only truly original creation that it keeps reinventing the cowboy myth. I'm not sure I totally buy that argument but Slipstream is evidence in support of the theory; it's a cowboy movie with aeroplanes. <br /><br />Actually it goes one better than that. It's a Spagetti Western with aeroplanes! Substitute the planes with horses, make the android a priest and this movie would be indistinguishable from any one of a dozen Italian Spanish semi-arty ""shoot-'em-ups with pretensions"" of the Seventies.<br /><br />The film isn't as BAD as I had been lead to believe by some of the reviews I had read here but it certainly wasn't good.",Negative,Negative,Negative,negative,"This review is a mixed assessment of the film ""Slipstream"", but ultimately leans towards a negative perspective. The reviewer starts by making an interesting observation about the film, likening it to a cowboy movie with aeroplanes, and even drawing parallels with Spaghetti Westerns. This comparison is not meant as a compliment, but rather as a way to highlight the film's unoriginality and lack of creativity.

The reviewer's tone is somewhat playful and sarcastic, using phrases like ""Yeeee-Haa!"" and ""shoot-'em-ups with pretensions"". This tone suggests that the reviewer is not taking the film too seriously and is somewhat amused by its shortcomings. However, the reviewer also states that the film ""isn't as BAD as I had been lead to believe"", implying that their expectations were low to begin with.

Despite this, the reviewer ultimately concludes that the film ""certainly wasn't good"". This statement, combined with the reviewer's sarcastic tone and criticism of the film's lack of originality, suggests that the review is more negative than positive.

6262,"Wow !! I didn't even know about this movie until I was searching for the name of another Mark Hamill classic (Time Runner). Some things are better left unknown.

The reviewer then criticizes Mark Hamill's limited role in the movie, comparing it to the brief appearances of Vincent Price and Christopher Lee in low-budget horror movies. The reviewer also mocks Hamill's lines, specifically the repeated phrase ""Don't try to run. You're under arrest,"" implying that the dialogue is unimpressive.

The reviewer also makes a humorous comment about Bill Paxton's appearance, joking that he must have been under the influence of drugs and alcohol during filming, given his hairstyle. The reviewer concludes that the movie is dull and boring, even comparing it unfavorably to another movie, ""The Crazies,"" which at least had the redeeming quality of being ""crazy."" The reviewer's final warning, ""DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE SOBER,"" is a clear indication that the movie is not worth watching.

6263,The film has so much potential which was not developed. Mark Hamill gives a good performance and so does Bill Paxton. The scenery is beautiful and the ultralight aircraft are neat. The problem with this film is that the story is way underdeveloped and the plot goes nowhere. The film at certain points almost puts you to sleep. I give it 3 out of 10 stars for the flying scenes.,Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review expresses disappointment and frustration with the film, highlighting its unfulfilled potential. The reviewer acknowledges the strong performances of Mark Hamill and Bill Paxton, as well as the visually appealing scenery and the unique ultralight aircraft. However, these positives are overshadowed by the underdeveloped storyline and lack of plot progression, which leads to a dull and sleep-inducing viewing experience.

The reviewer's criticism of the film's narrative is scathing, implying that the story fails to engage or move forward in a meaningful way. The only redeeming quality mentioned is the flying scenes, which earn the film a meager 3 out of 10 stars. This suggests that the reviewer's overall assessment of the film is largely negative, with the few positives being vastly outweighed by the negatives.

6264,"I saw this film when it first came out in the cinema. We were all looking forward to seeing Mark Hamill relaunch his career, but we came out wishing we hadn't bothered. Many people walked out after about half an hour - I wish I had too. The basic premise seems okay, but the plot was ridiculously involved and tortuous, and runs out half way through.

The reviewer mentions that they, along with others, were looking forward to Mark Hamill's return to the big screen, but the experience was a letdown. The plot is described as ""ridiculously involved and tortuous,"" implying that it was overly complex and difficult to follow. The reviewer also states that the film ""runs out"" halfway through, suggesting that it loses steam and becomes unengaging. The reviewer's tone is dismissive, implying that the film is not worth paying to see and is only suitable for killing time or helping one fall asleep.

The reviewer's use of phrases like ""I wish I had too"" (referring to walking out of the cinema) and ""not a film you want to have paid money to see"" emphasizes their strong negative opinion. The rating of 2/10 further reinforces this sentiment, indicating a near-total lack of enjoyment or appreciation for the film.

6267,"My overall feeling about this film is that it was a slow, drawn-out, structureless wander through some of the worlds genuinely unfortunate situations with a bit of redemption and an obvious message. The film is composed mostly of fairly uninteresting video footage of the countries he visits with bad reenactments, all slow-mo'ed down to a snails pace and overlaid with depressing music. Certainly some of the materials and interviews contain some compelling stories, but unlike what the description on the back suggests, it wasn't so much the victim's story that's being told as it is the director's, Mr. Ripper, and he doesn't tell it well. This film could have included longer, better interviews with the people themselves, letting them tell their stories. Instead Mr. Ripper indulgently draws the story towards himself making it some kind of personal journey, and unfortunately it doesn't end up being much of one. I never really got a sense of any growth as he explores the subject, and he never indicates what about the subject pulled him in in the first place. He just drags us from one place to the next, brushes lightly on the situation and characters, hangs around showing too much uneventful slow-motion footage of people just walking around the streets, then moves on to his next destination. He does this over, and over, and over again without any real development. I felt like this film could have been cut down to 45 minutes but it's drawn out to close to 2 crushingly slow hours. We feel morally obliged to care about the topic, but the director's self-indulgent, meandering, uninspired delivery of his journey makes you grow numb after a while.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, criticizing the film's slow pace, lack of structure, and self-indulgent storytelling. The reviewer argues that the film's attempt to explore unfortunate situations and offer redemption falls flat due to the director's poor execution. The use of slow-motion footage, depressing music, and reenactments is seen as unengaging and overly dramatic. The reviewer also criticizes the director's decision to focus on his own personal journey rather than allowing the victims to tell their own stories, which could have made the film more compelling.

The reviewer's frustration is evident in their criticism of the film's meandering pace, lack of character development, and excessive use of uneventful footage. They suggest that the film could have been condensed to 45 minutes, implying that the 2-hour runtime is unnecessarily long and drawn out.

The reviewer's tone is energetic and encouraging, with phrases like ""I recommend you to buy this game"" and ""make the game much more fun.""

6269,"On top of the fact that Skylar is a complete douche bag and his cons are unimaginative, his schemes require way to much preparation to make any of his scams worth while. Without giving away any spoilers (as if it matters with this piece of crap) his cons are such a sham because it takes the effort of days and days of planning, and the use of multiple accomplices and an entire camera crew etc. just to scam someone into a service that would cost less than a hundred bucks.....in addition if you read in the credits they re-stage some of the phone calls etc. because they don't pan out...The whole concept of this show is bunk because all of his cons have the cost in both the crew and the effort of ten times the actual cost of the service he is trying to get for free...what is the con?",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is extremely negative, with the reviewer expressing strong disdain for the main character, Skylar, and the show's concept. The reviewer's criticism is multifaceted, targeting Skylar's character, the cons themselves, and the show's production. Skylar is described as a ""complete douche bag,"" implying that the reviewer finds him unlikable and unrelatable. The reviewer also argues that the cons are ""unimaginative"" and not worth the effort, as they require extensive planning, multiple accomplices, and a camera crew, only to scam someone out of a relatively inexpensive service.

The reviewer's frustration is further fueled by the fact that some scenes, including phone calls, were re-staged, implying that the show is not even genuine in its portrayal of the cons. The reviewer's central argument is that the show's concept is flawed, as the cost of the crew, effort, and resources invested in the cons far outweighs the value of the service being scammed. This critique suggests that the show is not only unentertaining but also illogical and impractical.

The reviewer's tone is aggressive and dismissive, with phrases like ""piece of crap"" and ""what is the con?"" conveying a strong sense of disappointment and annoyance. Overall, the review is a scathing critique of the show, with the reviewer finding fault with nearly every aspect of its concept and execution.

Others have said it here already but this guy is a total fake and fraud, if you believe any of these cons I think you should seriously consider going to get your head checked because they're all fake, and the ones that might possibly be true are so pointless, like spending all day to con someone out of giving you an average meal at a restaurant?

6271,"What exactly is the point of pretending to ""con"" people out of things like ski passes and pizza? I fail to see a point. I'd not clever or original and it strikes me as being extremely pointless. <br /><br />Skyler Stone doesn't seem to be a very down-to-earth or even a nice guy. He has very little charisma and just about anyone could do what he does in this show. <br /><br />The worse thing about this piece of crap, is the fact that a lot of the phone calls are reenacted, so not only are they apparently conning the poor people on the other end of the phone, but they are also conning the audience who don't have enough time to read the ""disclaimed"" that flickers across the screen for about half a second at the beginning at the end of the show!<br /><br />Not only that but he also claims this is how he lives his whole life. What an lie.

This guy is an @$$!<br /><br />What makes them think that going to all the trouble of, for example, write and record a song, get someone to pain a HUGE picture of you and two mates, get dance lessons and actually travel to a ski resort is actually worth only getting free ski passes and some food for free?

It's an awful lot of trouble to go to just for a few ski passes and a bit of snow. <br /><br />As far as ""comedy"" goes, this is bottom of the barrel stuff.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is extremely negative, with the reviewer expressing strong disdain for the show and its star, Skyler Stone. The reviewer questions the purpose of the show, finding it pointless and lacking in originality or cleverness. They also criticize Stone, describing him as uncharismatic and unlikable, and suggesting that anyone could do what he does in the show.

The reviewer's strongest criticisms are directed at the show's deceptive nature, particularly the reenactment of phone calls, which they see as a con not only to the people on the other end of the phone but also to the audience. They also dismiss Stone's claim that he lives his life in a similar way to the show, calling it a blatant lie and an attempt to get attention.

The reviewer also questions the logic of going to great lengths to con people out of small rewards, such as free ski passes and food, and finds the show's attempts at comedy to be of poor quality.

6272,"I just finished watching this movie and largely found it a waste of time with little or no redeeming factors. I really don't understand where all the positive reviews came from -- the animation is clunky and unrefined, the plot makes no sense at all from an objective standpoint, and there is no sense of intrigue or suspense in that which is trying to pass itself off as an intriguing and suspenseful film. I have never read the book so I can't say if the movie was faithful, but as with most movie adaptations, it tries too hard to cram as much information into the shortest amount of time possible. The result is a disjointed and illogical storyline that doesn't really let you understand or relate to the characters, or, actually, anything at all. Overall, I felt completely detached from the characters and the plot to the point where I couldn't bring myself to care about what happened to them, and the only way I can see how this animation could be considered beautiful is if your normal standard of animation is a Scooby-Doo cartoon.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing strong disappointment and frustration with the film. The reviewer criticizes the animation, calling it ""clunky and unrefined,"" and states that the plot is nonsensical and lacks intrigue or suspense. They also express frustration with the pacing, feeling that the film tries to cram too much information into a short amount of time, resulting in a disjointed and illogical storyline. The reviewer claims that this makes it impossible to connect with the characters or care about their fate.

The reviewer's tone is scathing, with a hint of incredulity that others have given the film positive reviews. They imply that the film's animation is subpar, comparing it unfavorably to a Scooby-Doo cartoon. The reviewer's detachment from the characters and plot is evident, and they seem to be puzzled by the film's inability to engage them on any level.

6273,"""Blame it on Rio"" is a romantic comedy 80's style, with more than an eye full of sex throughout its 101 minute running time.<br /><br />The plot concerns two middle-aged men in crisis, one of whom is sorting through his divorce, the other dealing with the possibility of that same prospect. Both good friends, they decide to take a vacation in exotic Rio de Janeiro, each with a daughter at their side. Complications set in when one of them gets involved with the other's daughter.<br /><br />This potential riot of a story is fairly funny and there are some good lines, however it never really becomes hilarious, as it could have. Any attempt at handling the moral issue seriously doesn't work either, and perhaps director Donen should have stuck to the humour of the situation.<br /><br />Not a bad film, but what really ruins it is Michelle Johnson's awful performance as the naughty little temptress Jennifer. While she uses her body to full advantage, it's the only thing she's got. Michelle's acting prowess leaves a great deal to be desired. No wonder we haven't seen her in anything else.<br /><br />Friday, January 7, 1994 - Video",Negative,Negative,Negative,negative,"This review of ""Blame it on Rio"" is mixed, but ultimately leans towards a negative assessment. The reviewer acknowledges that the film has some humorous moments and good lines, but criticizes its failure to reach its full comedic potential. The plot, which revolves around two middle-aged men and their daughters in Rio de Janeiro, has the potential to be a ""riot"" but falls short. The reviewer also expresses disappointment with the film's attempt to tackle moral issues, suggesting that the director should have focused more on the humor.

The main criticism, however, is directed towards Michelle Johnson's performance as Jennifer, which is deemed ""awful."" The reviewer believes that Johnson relies too heavily on her physical appearance and lacks acting talent, which ultimately detracts from the film's overall quality.

While the reviewer doesn't entirely dismiss the film, calling it ""not bad,"" the criticisms and negative comments outweigh the positive remarks. The tone of the review is more critical than praising, indicating that the reviewer's overall opinion of the film is unfavorable.

6274,"All in all, don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />And if you want to see a movie that will take you back to 1983, this will do that for sure. The only reason I gave this movie 2 points more than it deserves is for 2 reasons:<br /><br />#1. Michael Caine<br /><br />#2. the people, the sights, the culture and the music of Brazil <br /><br />The movie is almost completely carried by Caine as he commits the seemingly impossible task of transforming it into a viable and semi-believable story. Even Joe Bologna and Valerie Harper fall short. <br /><br />Michael Caine is pure class, as always. Besides being a gifted classical and comic actor, Caine brings a blend of introspection, mischievousness and sensitivity to every movie he does ... the focus of his charm as far back as his role in Alfie...and the reason why he won the Academy Award for Hannah and her Sisters 2 years later. In this farce, he is tenderly beguiling...funny and vulnerable... melancholy and sentimental....and besides the jewel that is Rio de Janeiro, the ONLY reason to not seek out a better form of entertainment.<br /><br />Well...maybe a glimpse at the 2 lovely young actresses, Michelle Johnson and Demi Moore would be a reason. But look is all you can do at Michelle (though her look seems sorely dated)....there couldn't be a more painful movie experience than watching her ""try"" to act (most of her dialogue seems overdubbed, too). Demi's acting and looks hold up 100 times better and you could easily transplant her, as is, into any movie today (she doesn't really look much different to be honest). Ms. Moore is surely underused, especially considering she was the bigger star of the 2. <br /><br />Save the fact that it is a silly farce, at the end, I actually kind of like the maturity with which all these people handle this scandalous situation...that it doesn't end friendships nor marriages and that an affair, even with the underage daughter of your best friend, could be forgiven and everyone can move on. The injured parties do show anger and disappointment at what transpired, but all works out for the best....a bit unrealistic for sure, but surprisingly refreshing. Hope always is.",Negative,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is a mixed assessment of the movie, with the reviewer expressing both positive and negative sentiments. On the one hand, the reviewer praises Michael Caine's performance, stating that he is ""pure class"" and that he ""transforms [the movie] into a viable and semi-believable story."" The reviewer also appreciates the film's setting in Rio de Janeiro and the appearances of Michelle Johnson and Demi Moore. Additionally, the reviewer finds the movie's mature handling of a scandalous situation to be ""refreshing.""

On the other hand, the reviewer is critical of the movie's overall quality, stating that it's only worth watching for Michael Caine's performance and the Brazilian setting. The reviewer also expresses disappointment with the acting of Michelle Johnson, calling her performance ""painful"" and suggesting that her dialogue was overdubbed. The reviewer also notes that the movie is a ""silly farce"" and that it's not a particularly good film.

Despite the criticisms, the reviewer's tone is somewhat affectionate and nostalgic, with a sense of fondness for the movie's 1980s charm. The reviewer seems to be saying that while the movie is not great, it has some redeeming qualities that make it worth watching.

6275,Not the funniest movie ever.....but I have to watch this film at least once a year just so I can fall in Love with Michelle Johnson all over again. She never looked better than she did in this film. by the way The story is good too.,Negative,positive,positive,positive,"This review is brief but exudes a sense of affection and admiration for the film. The reviewer starts by downplaying the film's comedic value, implying that it may not be the funniest movie ever made. However, this criticism is quickly overshadowed by their enthusiasm for Michelle Johnson's appearance in the film. The reviewer's tone becomes romantic and nostalgic, confessing that they watch the film annually to relive their infatuation with Johnson's on-screen presence. The reviewer's focus on Johnson's physical appearance might seem superficial, but it reveals a deeper emotional connection with the film.

The reviewer's casual mention of the story being ""good too"" suggests that the plot is secondary to their primary attraction to Johnson's character. This admission does not detract from the reviewer's overall positive sentiment, as their affection for the film is rooted in their emotional response to Johnson's performance.

Answer: Positive"
6276,"This movie should be called Blame it on the Script. Directed by Stanley Donen, of Singin' in the Rain fame, this celluloid mid-life crisis is not all bad. It's got some lush scenes of Rio de Janeiro and various scantily clad extras cavorting with each other and romping around the beach to the sultry sounds of samba, but there is just something about watching fifty-something Michael Caine get it on with whiny teenager Michelle Johnson that makes you feel...well, sleazy. This storyline is a complete stretch, too. Nobody but pervy and vain old studio execs in Hollywood could have green-lit this embarrassment. Maybe they are so used to having young bimbos as arm candy that they forget it's their fat wallets that hold the key to their appeal, not their huge Larry King-style spectacles and yellow cigar-stained teeth. It's one thing for a nubile young sexpot to have a crush on an older man, but on her best friend's father who happens to be married? And then to throw herself at him shamelessly? Ugh! There's nothing entertaining about that. It's rather pathetic and grotesque. Take note of a young Demi Moore's budding *cough* talent.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing strong disdain for the film's storyline, characters, and themes. The reviewer criticizes the film's portrayal of an older man (Michael Caine) engaging in a romantic relationship with a much younger woman (Michelle Johnson), calling it ""sleazy"" and ""pathetic."" The reviewer also mocks the film's script, implying that it was greenlit by out-of-touch Hollywood executives who are oblivious to their own flaws. The tone of the review is sarcastic and dismissive, with the reviewer using phrases like ""celluloid mid-life crisis"" and ""embarrassment"" to describe the film.

The only positive comment made is a brief mention of the film's scenic depiction of Rio de Janeiro, but even this is quickly overshadowed by the reviewer's overall negativity. The reviewer also takes a jab at Demi Moore's early acting career, implying that her ""talent"" is questionable.

6277,"I saw this in the theatre a couple decades ago, and fuzzy recollection suggests that I liked it. However, seeing it for a second time two things stand out: (1) very poor acting on the part of Michelle Johnson, and (2) very poor music throughout.<br /><br />It's not that all the music was bad. Some of the Brazilian music was fine, but the theme song and others that clanged their way in were reminiscent of the worst of '80s pop music.<br /><br />Johnson's voice seemed all wrong, possibly dubbed. This was distracting.<br /><br />On the positive side: (1) The story's not bad, (2) it's interesting seeing such a young Demi Moore, (3) Valerie Harper never looked better, and (4) Johnson did look quite fetching in various stages of disattire.",Negative,Negative,Negative,negative,"This review is mixed, but overall, it leans towards a negative perspective. The reviewer mentions that they initially liked the film when they saw it in the theater, but upon re-watching it, they were struck by two major issues: poor acting by Michelle Johnson and subpar music. The reviewer specifically criticizes Johnson's voice, suggesting that it might have been dubbed, which they found distracting. They also dislike the theme song and other musical elements, comparing them unfavorably to 1980s pop music.

On the other hand, the reviewer does acknowledge some positive aspects, such as the story being ""not bad,"" Demi Moore's youthful appearance, Valerie Harper's attractive appearance, and Johnson's physical attractiveness in various scenes. However, these positives are outweighed by the reviewer's criticisms, which dominate the review.

Answer: Negative"
6278,"Yeah, I know the girls are hot and the scenery lovely but for someone knowing the place, it's hilarious.<br /><br />If you want some accuracy, this is not a movie to rely on. It starts with the flight from São Paulo to Rio aboard a 747. This will never happen on the 400 km flight. Smaller planes such as 737 or A-320 shuttle passengers between the two cities every half an hour. The drive from the airport home if shown on a map would reveal an intricate zig zag back and forth. Perhaps the producers tried to emulate one of the very known taxicab drivers itineraries when faced to tourists. Not that it would be a local habit as I myself got ripped off in very serious places such as Switzerland. The girls, yes. All topless. That's something an outsider will never understand. Brazilian chicks will be happy to expose 100 % of their incredible bodies at the Samba Schools parades and wear almost non-existent bikinis at beach, but never go topless. A handful beaches across the whole country will allow it. All carefully secluded and out of town. Oh, the indoor decoration; the amazing wallpaper... maybe in Disneyworld... Apart from that, it is very entertaining and, yes, Demi Moore is absolutely splendid.",Negative,"Mixed, but overall: negative",Mixed,positive,"This review is a mixed bag, with the reviewer expressing both amusement and frustration with the film's portrayal of Brazil. On one hand, the reviewer finds the film's inaccuracies and stereotypes humorous, particularly when it comes to the depiction of Brazilian culture and geography. The reviewer points out several mistakes, such as the use of a 747 for a short flight, a convoluted taxi route, and the unrealistic portrayal of topless women on beaches. The reviewer's tone is playful and lighthearted, suggesting that they are entertained by the film's mistakes.

On the other hand, the reviewer is also critical of the film's lack of accuracy and cultural sensitivity. They emphasize that the film's portrayal of Brazil is not representative of the country's culture and customs. The reviewer's comments about the film's decoration and set design, comparing it to Disneyworld, suggest that they find the film's aesthetic to be overly fantastical and unrealistic.

Despite these criticisms, the reviewer does acknowledge that the film is entertaining and that Demi Moore's performance is ""absolutely splendid."" Overall, the review is neither overwhelmingly positive nor negative, but rather a nuanced assessment of the film's strengths and weaknesses.

6279,"Michael Caine's character has problems. He's a plain, nearsighted, insecure man in his mid-40s. He's married but his wife doesn't seem to love him anymore.

What's the poor fellow to do? <br /><br />This movie should be taken out of the Comedy section and placed under Science Fiction. Only an intergalactic brain chip can explain the actions of Michelle Johnson's character.

This goes beyond a middle-aged male fantasy into something so delusional, you just hope that everyone involved voluntarily submitted to therapy.<br /><br />There's not really anything funny here. There are some quick attempts at wit from Caine, who often seems to playing Hawkeye Pierce more than a new character. Joseph Bologna is like fingernails on a chalkboard.

So buy the DVD, skip to scenes 4 and 9, and forget the rest.",Negative,negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing frustration and disbelief at the plot and characters of the movie. The reviewer mocks the idea that a beautiful young woman would be so intensely interested in the main character, played by Michael Caine, calling it a ""middle-aged male fantasy"" and suggesting that it's so unrealistic that it's almost science fiction. The reviewer also criticizes the acting, saying that Michelle Johnson is not a good actress and that Joseph Bologna's performance is grating. The only positive comment is a backhanded one, suggesting that viewers might want to buy the DVD just to see Michelle Johnson's nude scenes.

The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and dismissive, implying that the movie is not worth watching except for a few fleeting moments of nudity. The reviewer also expresses disappointment that Michael Caine, an actor they presumably respect, is wasted in this role. Overall, the review is scathing and suggests that the movie is not worth the viewer's time.

Okay, I guess. But a film this bad that wasted talent so good (Caine, Gelbart, and Donen) is a reason for mourning not a pleasant diversion.

6284,"An absolutely baffling western featuring flash-forward sequences set in an insane asylum, South of Hell Mountain was one of the first films produced by the schlockmeisters at Cannon Film.

The cast (most of whom never made another film) try gamely, but are hamstrung by the screenplay, which generally makes no sense.

6285,"I went into this film expecting/hoping for a sleazy drive-in style slice of seventies exploitation, but what I got was more of a bizarre pseudo western with far too much talking and not enough action. It's clear that this film was made on a budget; the locations are drab and poorly shot, while the acting leaves a lot to be desired also. The plot focuses on a trio of robbers (a father and two sons) that steal a load of gold after killing some miners. They come across a cabin inhabited by a young girl and her stepmother...and all this is told in flashbacks by the young girl, currently residing in an asylum. It's clear that directors Louis Leahman and William Sachs thought they were making something really shocking; but despite its best efforts, South of Hell Mountain is just too boring to shock the viewer. The film drones on for about eighty minutes and most of it consists of boring characters spouting off boring and long-winded dialogue. The only good thing I have to say about the film is with regards to the music; which is good in places.

The reviewer's expectations of a ""sleazy drive-in style slice of seventies exploitation"" were not met, and instead, they found a ""bizarre pseudo western"" with too much talking and not enough action. The reviewer criticizes the film's low budget, citing poor location shooting and subpar acting. The plot is also panned for being dull and unengaging, with too much repetitive and boring dialogue.

The reviewer does offer some faint praise for the film's music, but this is a minor consolation. The ending is also mentioned as a positive, but only because it marks the conclusion of the film. Overall, the reviewer's tone is dismissive and discouraging, advising readers not to bother tracking down the film, as there are better examples of 1970s exploitation cinema.

6286,"Well.....horror this ain't, but.......!!!??? A terrible low low budget backwood-flic of the worst kind, sort of AND...therefore quite charming and funny to watch...at least on my tv set!!!

The reviewer starts by expressing disappointment and frustration with the film, calling it a ""terrible low low budget backwood-flic of the worst kind."" They imply that the film's production values are subpar and that it lacks polish. However, as the review progresses, the tone shifts, and the reviewer begins to appreciate the film's inadvertent charm and humor. They compare it to other low-budget horror films, implying that it shares a similar B-movie aesthetic.

The reviewer's use of superlatives like ""charming,"" ""funny,"" and ""goldmine"" suggests that they have developed a fondness for the film's inadvertent entertainment value. They even go so far as to compare it to other cult classics, like ""Nekromantik"" and ""Blue Velvet,"" implying that it has a certain kitsch appeal. The reviewer's enthusiasm and use of colloquialisms (""oh maaaannnn!!!!!"") convey a sense of excitement and amusement.

While the reviewer acknowledges the film's technical shortcomings, they seem to revel in its inadvertent humor and camp value. This ambivalence towards the film's quality is a hallmark of so-bad-it's-good cinema, where the entertainment value lies in the film's inadvertent humor and charm.

6287,"I have seen this movie and in all honestly was quite disappointed. And in my opinion this movie lacks heart. I frankly didn't care what happen to the characters by the end of the movie. <br /><br />There was so much there they could have done with the movie that they didn't because they were either so rapped up in trying to be obscure and make some deep comment on life, or trying so hard not to, that the characters and story were completely lost in all of it. I have seen another picture by this director and enjoyed it well enough. But I felt this film lack of the whimsy and heart of the other and I was left wondering what the point was, or if the point of the movie was that it had no point.

The reviewer explicitly states that the movie ""lacks heart"" and that they didn't care about the characters by the end. The criticism is not just about the characters, but also the storytelling, which is seen as overly focused on being obscure or making a deep comment on life, rather than developing the narrative and characters. The reviewer compares this film unfavorably to another work by the same director, which they enjoyed more due to its ""whimsy and heart."" The tone of the review is one of disillusionment, with the reviewer questioning the point of the movie and feeling that their time was wasted.

The reviewer's language is telling, using phrases like ""sad little film"" and ""remorse the lost time"" to convey their disappointment. While they acknowledge that some people might enjoy the movie, their own experience was overwhelmingly negative.

6288,I know Terry Gilliam is considered as a good director but claiming that this movie is good is just foolish. What was the movie about? What is it a spoof? Fantasy? Comedy? Satire? No answer there from Gilliam's screenplay. Totally confused and pointlessly hurtling from one historical age to another. I find it amusing that some people actually call this movie magical. Is it because they have to praise any movie which is vague and indecisive on what it is about?? 3 stars for special effects considering it is 1981. Roger Ebert has it right in his review. The movie is ambiguous and looks like Gilliam's romp with money just to make a vague children's move masquerading as a historical revue. The movie also tries to confuse the would-be viewer by giving John Cleese and Sean Connery top billing.,Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing frustration and disappointment with Terry Gilliam's film. The reviewer criticizes the film's lack of clarity, stating that it fails to define its genre, tone, or purpose. The reviewer is confused by the film's meandering narrative, which jumps between different historical periods without a clear direction or message. The reviewer also accuses Gilliam of wasting resources on a vague and indecisive film that masquerades as a historical revue.

The reviewer's tone is dismissive and sarcastic, implying that those who praise the film are doing so out of obligation or a desire to appear sophisticated. The reviewer agrees with Roger Ebert's negative review, suggesting that the film is overly ambitious and self-indulgent. The only positive comment made is a faint praise for the special effects, but even this is tempered by the acknowledgment that it was 1981, implying that the effects were not particularly impressive even for their time.

The reviewer's criticism of the film's marketing is also notable, suggesting that the top billing of John Cleese and Sean Connery is misleading and intended to confuse viewers. Overall, the review is scathing and dismissive, implying that the film is a waste of time and resources.

6289,"I got this movie from the library, and saw it had a lot of actors I like in it(John Cleese, Ian Holm, Ralph Richardson, etc), so I got it and watched it. I expected Cleese to have a large role since he had first billing, I was surprised to find out that he had about five minutes of screen time, along with everyone else I liked. This movie is amazingly pointless, the characters are nobodies, the plot is non-existent, and the ending is one of the worst endings I have ever seen. There were a few funny parts, but that's about it. Stay away from this movie if you want to prevent going ""What?"" and ""Huh?"", a lot. And if you don't want to waste your time.

The main issue seems to be the misleading billing, with John Cleese having only a minor role, and the same applies to other notable actors. The reviewer criticizes the film for having poorly developed characters, a non-existent plot, and a terrible ending. The reviewer does acknowledge a few humorous moments, but this is not enough to redeem the film's numerous shortcomings.

The reviewer's tone is warning, urging potential viewers to avoid the film at all costs, implying that it's a waste of time.

6290,"For some reason I just didn't like it at all and felt embarrassed about how bad it was since I bought it and watched it with my family. All of us hated it with a passion. It's a nice enough kids' movie, maybe in the year it came out. However, think about it: an outdated kids' movie? What's the point? Kids do not generally like to watch such old movies anyway, and I don't see what adults are supposed to get out of this movie at all.<br /><br />Some kids' movies (like Mary Poppins or Wizard of Oz) can be enjoyed even now, but Time Bandits is totally outdated. For your reference, and I think applicable in this case, I also did not like Dr Strangelove or Spinal Tap at all. So, if you disagree with me on those similarly outdated movies, you might like Time Bandits.<br /><br />There is also a horrible case of overacting as I recall from the 'bad guys'. Think of the two stupid 'bad pirates' in the Pirates of the C. movies, except in Time Bandits they are not even remotely funny.<br /><br />Anyway, I warned you, that's all I can do.

They criticize the movie as being outdated, stating that kids are unlikely to enjoy old movies, and adults won't find anything appealing in it either.

The reviewer also mentions their dislike for other films, such as Dr. Strangelove and Spinal Tap, suggesting that people who disagree with their opinion on those films might enjoy Time Bandits. However, this is not a positive endorsement, as the reviewer is implying that only those with similar tastes in outdated films might appreciate Time Bandits.

Additionally, the reviewer criticizes the overacting of the ""bad guys"" in the film, likening them to the comedic relief in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, but without the humor. The reviewer concludes by warning potential viewers not to bother watching the film, implying that it's not worth their time.

6291,"This show has shown it's true colors now that Democrats are in power.

6292,"I have tried watching this show on several different occasions and each time found it to be utterly pale of humor.<br /><br />The reason, to mention one thing, is that it is solely based on ridiculing anything the Republicans have done.

6293,"Comedy works best when it relates to stuff that's true. But even as such, some effort is required to make jokes that everyone likes and even the most grumpy of viewers can crack a smile. When I look at the Daily Show, I see the whole ""it's funny because it's true"" thing, but I don't, however, see the effort and often times I don't if they're being funny or just trying to make a point(I notice this mostly in the interview segments). The Daily Show started off as a news parody, by definition they poke fun at how the media plays it's own news by pretending to be inept and dumb news reporters and anchormen and they tackled tons of subjects from science to movies and sometimes politics, then Jon Stewart came along...and it all went to Hell. Thr first years of Jon Stewart's reign were arguably golden, I though he was so funny, but then 2004 came along and it's where you start to notice a huge chance in the show from there on. The show's humor has gone stale, Colbert left, Steve Carell left, many of the show's best anchors left and now it's mostly about Jon Stewart and the show's gone from a parody to a semi-serious news show, essentially Evening News but with some gags here and there. For those who haven't seen the show and are having trouble finding out what to watch on cable, I'll give you a brief description of what the show's about(at least until 2009): -Bush, Cheney and all Republicans(unless they happen to embrace an opinion shared by Democrats as well) are stupid, evil, corrupt and hypocrites, anyone who stands by conservative beliefs is also evil, corrupt and a hypocrite; -people who doubt the man-made global warming theory are evil and stupid; -vote Democrat; There, I saved you 25 minutes of your time, go watch something else. At first, I though that the producers hijacked the show for their own personal political agenda, but when I actually see the interviews, it becomes crystal clear what this show's about(what I mentioned above), but I'll get to that in a moment. Frist off, the humor in The Daily Show according to Jon Stewart expects you to find a random filmed quote said by either Bush, Cheney or a random republican humorous because well, because. Jon sets up the joke, setting it in writers specific context and expects that the random quote somehow delivers the punchline. So, unless you «get» the context, it's entirely useless as bankable humor. Also the Daily Show expects you to laugh when they show a montage of one politician talking and in another separate video saying another thing, again putting into a context that the writers expect you to understand, thus making it funny,why? Well, because Jon said so. Now imagine The Daily Show using that formula countless times for years every week, and you'll start to understand of what used to be a laugh-fest that is now 25 minutes of just silent stares(yes, even in the Lewis Black segments). At first, some decent amount of effort was put into these jokes, but now much less of that is apparent. And the interview have the most odd sense of bias that I've ever seen. Jon Stewart calls Bill O'Reilly a bully, but what does that make him, when he sucks up to every single actor and democrat(John Kerry before, Obama today) that appears on the show and looks down upon respected republicans and accomplished conservative newsmen such as Weekly Standard's own Bill Kristol? He puts them in some sort of people's tribunal as if they're being charged with a crime, often times any person on the show who stands up for Bush is portrayed as delusional, as if that person's out of touch with reality and assumes he speaks for the majority of America, that's the de facto treatment for anybody conservative, unless they happen to share a similar point of view with Democrats, if so then's it's an endless love fest. But still, it doesn't matter, in the eyes of Jon you are already wrong before you walked into the show and are still wrong afterwords. That's the kind of treatment you get if you are anything remotely right-wing. Now you have to wonder what that could possibly have anything to do with humor. One wonders what'll happen if Democrats win the White House...",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, criticizing The Daily Show with Jon Stewart for its perceived bias, lack of effort in its humor, and transformation from a news parody to a semi-serious news show. The reviewer argues that the show's humor has become stale, relying on cheap shots at Republicans and conservatives, and that the show's format has changed significantly since Jon Stewart took over. The reviewer accuses the show of having a clear political agenda, promoting Democratic views and demonizing conservative beliefs. The reviewer also criticizes the interview segments, claiming that Jon Stewart and the show's writers display a clear bias against conservative guests, treating them with disdain and condescension.

The reviewer's tone is scathing, implying that the show has abandoned its original purpose as a news parody and has become a platform for promoting a particular political ideology.

6295,"First of all, the title ""DAILY"" is a LIE. <br /><br />Every ""Daily Show"" program opens with an on-screen visual of the date it was made, followed by a pause and the opening announce. On the many days when they are RE-RUNNING a Daily Show, they slip-cue the tape and OMIT the date and begin with the opening announce giving the false impression that the show is a new one. That's a lie. There is no mention of it being a rebroadcast.

The plot is described as ""uninspired,"" implying a lack of originality and creativity.

The performances of the actors are dismissed as ""flat"" and lacking in passion and talent, while the dialogue is seen as unremarkable and predictable.

The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and dismissive, with a sense of annoyance and frustration. The use of rhetorical questions and exclamations (""?!??!?!"") adds to the sense of exasperation.

6298,"This was something I had been looking forward to seeing. The Ultimate Avengers movies had both exceeded my expectations and since Iron Man has been one of my favorite Marvel characters I thought that this same production team would be able to do some really great stuff with an Iron Man solo title.

Not a major complaint but not what I expected from the ads and box. The worse thing however was the story, the acting and the cell-shaded CGI animation for the monsters and Iron Man armor that was not convincing. It didn't blend in well with the cell animation at all. Even on it's own it seem stick-like and lifeless. Tony Stark's character arc, as incredibly slow as it takes, is so forced and unconvincing.

6299,"I have been collecting Iron Man comics since the early 70s and always enjoyed the character who is far far from the average clean cut hero and his many and varied enemies. There have been no less than three attempts at an animated series for Iron Man and only the original and part of the second have ever done the character justice. So I was somewhat hopeful that this newest version would be good. Boy was I wrong! The DVD art is VERY misleading and presents an image that is not the movie. Fist off the good, what little there is... The art and animation are well drawn and the writing and dialog are generally good, though with notable exceptions. Character voices are very well selected and each character is distinctive and well acted. Now for the bad... Unfortunately the writers opted to totally screw around with both Iron Man's origin and especially the Mandarin's. On top of that they decided to do Iron Man and his opponents all in CGI. Bad CGI. This makes them stand out almost as badly as live actors would in a cartoon. The CG work is often repetitive and glaring shortcuts are taken at times. The CG battles are clumsy as well, further enhancing the fact that CG and line animation do not mix well. The movie would certainly have fared better had they opted to actually DRAW all the characters. Another problem is that Iron Man is in his traditional Red and Gold suit for all of ONE battle! And its not even the big fight at the end. All this drags the movie down and it never picks up.<br /><br />************ SPOILERS (or warnings) MAY FOLLOW ************<br /><br />The movie starts off with an interestingly unusual stop motion credit sequence of machinery, welding and gears. Then we are introduced to what looks like a Chinese temple in the process of being restored, and prominent is a statue of what fans will recognize as the Mandarin. Things go strangely, impeding progress in restoring the temple. Overseeing it is James Rhodes, Tony Stark's long time friend. Seems they plan to actually raise the temple up from the earth, despite opposition by a group who insist that raising the temple will bring about a terrible disaster. Rhodes is captured in a raid. Stark, shown in a hot tub with a lovely lady, is informed of the problems and sets out to personally oversee the project and rescue his friend while in the background his father deals with Board Executives who are pushing to have Tony removed. Tony arrives only to have his armored escort ambushed and blown to pieces. Tony later awakens mortally wounded in the heart and a prisoner of the rebels. He is saved only by quick action from Rhodes and a scientist. Eventually Stark must build the prototype gray iron armor and makes good an escape, but only after some loss of life. While with the rebels he meets a troubled girl named Li Mei, and the two fall in love. The Temple is raised and four elemental beings (all done in CG) appear and proceed to start collecting hidden rings of power. Stark and Rhody find trouble back home but manage to confront the elementals without success in really stopping them, First using the Aquatic Armor, then the more classic Red and Gold Armor and finally everything returns to the temple and Stark is back in the bulky gray armor for a final showdown and a run in with what may be Fin Fang Foom (also in CG.) Here the story takes a major twist as it turns out that the Mandarin needs a host body to manifest. This leads to a somewhat tragic final battle marred by the fact that the Mandarin is little more than a ghost and isn't seen till the last 5 minutes of the movie. ugh...<br /><br />If you are an Iron Man fan then you will likely not enjoy this outing. And even non-fans may well find the movie somewhat lacking or not.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with the animated Iron Man movie. The reviewer, a long-time Iron Man comic book collector, had high hopes for the film but was let down by the writers' decisions to alter the character's origin and the Mandarin's backstory. The reviewer criticizes the use of CGI, calling it ""bad"" and stating that it clashes with the traditional animation. They also lament the fact that Iron Man's iconic red and gold suit is only featured briefly in the movie.

The reviewer praises the art, animation, and voice acting, but these positives are vastly outweighed by the negatives. The reviewer is particularly upset about the changes to the characters and the story, which they feel do not stay true to the original comic book series. The review concludes by warning other Iron Man fans that they will likely not enjoy this movie, and even non-fans may find it lacking.

6300,"I am a fifth grade language arts teacher, and after we read this book (which the students loved), then we watched the movie. They laughed out loud! Unfortunately, it's NOT a comedy! The acting was so awful, I felt like I was watching a bunch of kids in the neighborhood putting on a play. My students were mimicking the lines and making fun off and on the whole way through. I have to agree with them, at times, it was pretty bad. Still, I would show it to students again, just for fun, and to compare the film with the book. We did a Venn Diagram (teachers know what that is) afterward, to show what was the same in both and what were the differences, so there is an educational value in showing it. I noticed that another adaptation is being filmed for 2005 so we can only hope the acting will be better!",Negative,"Mixed, but overall: negative",Negative,negative,"This review is a mixed bag, with both positive and negative sentiments expressed. On the one hand, the reviewer, a fifth-grade language arts teacher, acknowledges that the movie adaptation of the book was entertaining for their students, who laughed out loud and enjoyed mimicking the lines. The reviewer also recognizes the educational value of showing the film, as it allowed for a comparison with the book and facilitated a Venn Diagram exercise to highlight the similarities and differences between the two.

On the other hand, the reviewer is critical of the acting, describing it as ""awful"" and likening it to a neighborhood play. They agree with their students that the movie had its cringe-worthy moments. The reviewer's tone is lighthearted and humorous, but the criticism of the acting is a significant aspect of the review.

Despite the negative comments, the reviewer concludes that they would show the movie again for its entertainment value and educational benefits. The mention of a new adaptation being filmed in 2005 suggests that the reviewer is hopeful for a better production in the future.

6301,"I was in 6th grade and this movie aired on PBS during a series called 'Wonderworks.' I distinctly remember sitting on a couch watching the movie with tears running down my face at the end. In the film Jesse, the main character, forms an unusual friendship with a girl named Leslie. Due to a very simple, but careless mistake one of the pair dies. At the time, I found the story very powerful, because the fatal mistake is exactly the type of mistake a kid would make and so any kid watching the film will find it very easy to identify with and feel the emotional weight of the tragedy that ensues.<br /><br />Last year, I finally tracked down a VHS copy of the show. I probably should have stuck with my memories. Watching the show as an adult I was absolutely shocked by what a horribly made film this was. My girlfriend had a similar memory of the movie as well, and she too was pretty sad about how bad the movie was compared to her memories. <br /><br />Many adults probably have a good memory of watching this movie when they were kids. I strongly advise that these people leave their memories intact, and avoid seeing this film as an adult.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is a mix of nostalgia and disappointment. The reviewer fondly remembers watching the movie as a 6th grader, being deeply moved by the story and its emotional impact. The film's portrayal of an unlikely friendship and the tragic consequences of a careless mistake resonated with the reviewer as a child. However, upon re-watching the movie as an adult, the reviewer was shocked by how poorly made the film was, which greatly contrasted with their cherished childhood memories.

The reviewer's tone is cautionary, advising others who hold fond memories of the movie to avoid re-watching it as adults, lest they be disappointed by the film's shortcomings. This suggests that the reviewer's initial positive experience with the movie has been overshadowed by their later disappointment, leading to a negative assessment of the film.

6302,"I have recently gone to the movie theatres to see the new (2007) version of Bridge to Teribithia. After, I went to the library to rent the older version to see it again without paying again. I must say that I was extremely disappointed! I found the older version to have horrible acting as well as corny lines including Jessie saying, ""I know Daddy, but I hurt so much inside"" after Leslie dies. It was quite horribly done and the casting was not much better in my opinion. I watched in amazement all the while saying no wonder they remade it. The story is great but trust me spend the money and see the new version, if you just see the old one you may never experience the true magic of Teribithia.",Negative,Negative,negative,positive,"This review is a scathing critique of the older version of ""Bridge to Terabithia"" (1985), with the reviewer expressing extreme disappointment and dismay at the acting, dialogue, and overall production quality. The reviewer specifically highlights the ""horrible acting"" and ""corny lines"" that detract from the story's emotional impact. The quote provided, ""I know Daddy, but I hurt so much inside,"" is cited as an example of the film's poor writing and over-the-top performances. The reviewer's tone is one of incredulity, with phrases like ""I watched in amazement"" and ""no wonder they remade it,"" implying that the original film is so flawed that a remake was necessary.

In contrast, the reviewer implies that the 2007 remake is superior, urging readers to ""spend the money and see the new version"" to experience the ""true magic of Terabithia."" This review is overwhelmingly negative towards the older version, with the reviewer's criticism aimed at the film's technical aspects rather than the story itself.

The reviewer criticizes the acting as ""generally pretty weak"" and notes that the dubbed dialogue comes across poorly. The only slight praise is given to Annette O'Toole's performance, but even that is tempered by the reviewer's overall negative assessment.

The reviewer does acknowledge some redeeming qualities, such as the film's brevity, which allows it to cover the plot and character development in a relatively short amount of time. The settings and cinematography are also deemed ""OK,"" but these positives are not enough to outweigh the reviewer's overall dissatisfaction.

The reviewer's tone is somewhat dismissive, implying that the film's shortcomings are to be expected from a TV movie. The final sentence, which suggests that some viewers might enjoy the film for sentimental reasons, comes across as a backhanded compliment.

6304,"This year's Eurovision was to me a big disappointment. I've watched the Eurovision Song Contest every year since 1986 (well, at least that's the earliest one I can remember, and I was only 2 at the time). As any other year this one contained both good, bad and horrible songs - nothing new there. However this year's show was the worst one I can remember. Only very few good (decent's probably more like it) songs and a lot of absolutely terrible songs.<br /><br />Turkey's winner song ""Every Way That I Can"" sounded to me like a rip-off of Turkish singer Tarkan's hit ""Simarik"", just sounding a lot worse. It didn't deserve to win from my point of view. Belgium's song ""Sanomi"", coming in second, was a no-language song. Wonder what's next? Animals singing? Nevertheless the music for the song was quite catchy, giving the song a kind of dreamy feeling, to which the ""lyrics"" seemed appropriate. One of the better songs, but that's not saying much.<br /><br />After one of the closest races in Eurovision history Russian duo t.A.T.u. ended in third place just three points behind Turkey and behind Belgium, with ""Ne Ver', Ne Boisia"" (""Don't Trust, Don't Be Afraid""). To me t.A.T.u. was one of the very few highlights of the show, surprising just about everyone by being some of the most covered up girls of all the female contestants. They let their song do the talking and if we ignore the fact that they failed to pitch a few times in the first chorus, they let the song speak very well indeed.<br /><br />The biggest surprise when looking at the scoreboard was Austria. The bookmakers here in Denmark had the biggest odds on that song - a song that indeed was beyond horrible - but ended up in 8th place. Could it be that bum of his being shaken to the rhythm of the song? That performance was the one that made me and my family laugh the most, not because it looked good, but because it looked so stupid that it was actually fun.<br /><br />Sweden did what they do the best; ABBA. In 1999 they won with ""Take Me To Your Heaven"", by sounding like ABBA. In 2001 they made the top 10 with ""Listen To Your Heartbeat"", again sounding like ABBA, and once again this year they did it ABBA-style, again ending in the top 10.<br /><br />England was finally punished for making those absolutely horrible, non-catching songs, that they've been the past years.<br /><br />Ireland ripped off the winner from 2000, ""Fly On The Wings Of Love"". And I could go on and on about how bad the songs were.<br /><br />I feel a bit sorry for the Aussies, who this year finally got the chance to see the Eurovision Song Contest. They deserved better than this.<br /><br />I wasn't surprised by the show though. The Eurovision from 2000 to me stands out as one of the best in recent years. 2001 was quite good, but not as good. 2002 was okay, but certainly no more. This year was quite simply disappointing.<br /><br />Let's hope it'll get better next year. If not for us, then at least for the Aussies.<br /><br />4/10.

The winner, Turkey's ""Every Way That I Can"", is dismissed as a rip-off of another song, and the reviewer questions its deserving of the top spot. The reviewer does acknowledge a few highlights, such as t.A.T.u.'s performance, but overall, the tone is one of disappointment and disillusionment.

The reviewer's criticism extends to specific countries' performances, with Austria's being singled out as particularly bad, and England's being punished for consistently producing poor songs.

6308,"I didn't particularly like Sliding Doors or Twice Upon a Yesterday, so I certainly didn't this poor second-rate excuse for those films. An idea that's been done to death (what would happen if...?) and the script is shoddy and unsuccessful, not to mention the obvious attempt at adding sex/nudity simply to gain an R rating and certain scenes that just weren't necessary but were there to push the boundaries (I really don't need to see a kid urinating or a struggle with a diaphragm.

6310,"Basically the first two Critters movie were already silly ones but in a good and entertaining way. This movie is way more of a B-movie, that is silly but for all of the wrong reasons.<br /><br />This is the first sequel that doesn't really follows the plot of the first two movies. Basically all of the characters are new and there are no bounty hunters this time (well, as good as none, since the bounty hunter in this movie shows up far too late) and the budget for this one obviously went down again. To save even more costs, the movie got shot back-to-back with part 4, which I imaging will be just as bad, since it directly follows this movie and got made by the same people involved as with this one.<br /><br />It's just a typical B-genre movie, that doesn't really have any originality in it or brings entertainment. It makes ""Critters 3"" a real redundant sequel, you can easily do without. Granted that things could had been way worse for this movie but it just ain't exactly a good one either. The movie just falls flat as a science-fiction/horror/comedy.<br /><br />Also kind of strange to notice how the Critters has suddenly changed in this one. They are about double their usual size this time, without giving an explanation for that and they are even more Gremlins like in this movie than was the case in the previous one.<br /><br />The movie is only made interesting because this was the feature film debut of Leonardo DiCaprio. He was about 17 in this movie and of course looking baby-faced like he still does now. I like watching this well known actors in their early roles. It's fun to see how they act and if their style has improved and changed over the years. Of course DiCaprio got only better but he already was kind of delivering his lines in the same way as he does these days.<br /><br />Really a too silly and lame movie.<br /><br />4/10",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is predominantly negative, criticizing the third installment of the Critters franchise for its lack of originality, poor production values, and failure to entertain. The reviewer expresses disappointment that the film deviates from the plot of the first two movies, introducing new characters and abandoning the bounty hunter element. The reduced budget is also seen as a significant drawback, resulting in a B-movie feel that lacks the charm of its predecessors. The Critters themselves have undergone an unexplained transformation, growing in size and resembling Gremlins more closely.

The only redeeming aspect of the film, according to the reviewer, is the early appearance of Leonardo DiCaprio, which provides a nostalgic interest in watching the actor's early work. However, this is not enough to redeem the movie's overall shortcomings. The reviewer concludes that the film is redundant, lacking in entertainment value, and ultimately a ""too silly and lame"" addition to the franchise.

6311,"Critters 3 starts on the open road as Clifford (John Calvin) his teenage daughter Annie (Aimee Brooks) & his young son Johnny (the IMDb list two actor's Christian & Josephh Cousins, identical twins perhaps?) are heading back home from a vacation. Suddenly the tyre on their van blows & they have to stop at a public rest area to fix it. While there Annie & Johnny meet a kid named Josh (Leonardo DiCaprio, yes that one) who in turn all run into Charlie McFadden (the films co-producer Don Keith Opper) from the previous two Critter films. Charlie tells them the story of the Critters & the town of Grovers Bend but they don't believe him. Meanwhile back at the van a Critter lays some eggs on it's underside, out of sight from everyone. Once Clifford has fixed the tyre the trio set off for their home, a run down urban tenement block in Los Angeles somewhere complete with Critter eggs along for the ride. Upon arrival the eggs hatch & the Critters head straight inside the tenement block quickly disposing of Frank (Geoffrey Blake), the caretaker. As the night draws on the few remaining residents, a fat woman named Rosalie (Diana Bellamy), a telephone repair woman Marsha (Katherine Cortez), an elderly couple Mr. (Bill Zuckert) & Mrs. Menges (Frances Bay) must come together with Clifford & his kids to fight the Critters. Josh also makes an appearance as his Stepfather (William Dennis Hunt) owns the building. But will the group be able to defeat the Critters & prevent themselves from becoming dinner?<br /><br />Directed Kristine Peterson I thought Critters 3 was an incredibly undistinguished film, but at least she can say she made a film staring Leonardo DiCaprio & not many people can say that! The budget for Critters 3 probably wasn't exactly a fortune as the whole production looks cheap throughout, there are very few characters, very few Critters & I think only 3 ever appear in the same shot at once & it does away with any sort of space angle so there are no expensive spaceship or distant alien planet special effects to pay for. The script by David J. Schow is strictly by-the-numbers & very predictable. A group of humans are stuck in an isolated situation with Critters & have no means of contacting the outside world for help, that plot scenario sounds very familiar right? Well it's same as the previous Critters (1986) & Critters 2: The Main Course (1988) & many other horror films so it should. Critters 3 does nothing with the premise, it never even tries to add anything to an already old, tired & well used storyline. Critters 3 is also very tame for a horror film with only two people actually being killed, the comedy elements are seriously lacking as well with the best joke Critters 3 can mange being a Critter eating some beans & then farting, very funny if your about 5 years old. The characters are mostly standard horror film clichés & quickly became annoying. There is virtually no blood or gore in Critters 3 at all, just a few splashes of blood & disappointingly Critters 3 in fact seems to go out of it's way not to show any violence. The special effects on the Critters are OK but they still look like static, simplistic hand-puppets that have very little movement. The acting isn't that good & Critters 3 happens to be a certain Leonardo DiCaprio's very first feature film, to be fair to the kid he's alright & I wonder if any of the other cast or crew had an idea what he go on to become. Why on Earth does that Charlie guy have to keep popping up in these Critter films? To give Critters 3 some credit it moves along at a good pace & isn't boring, it's generally well made with nice enough production values & it's a bit of harmless fun if your in the right sort of mood & thankfully it only lasts for about 80 odd minutes. Overall Critters 3 is an OK time waster but don't expect anything deep or meaningful. There's nothing really wrong with it as cheap horror film but I couldn't help feeling that I'd seen it all before. An average time-waster that isn't as good as either of the previous two Critter films. Critters 3 ends with a 'to be continued...' as this was filmed back to back with Critters 4 (1991) which unsurprisingly went straight to video, probably to save even more money. Critters 3 is a decent enough way to waste 80 odd minutes if you can watch it on T.V. for free otherwise don't bother.",Negative,Negative,Negative,negative,"This review of Critters 3 is largely negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with the film's lack of originality, cheap production values, and predictable plot.

6313,"*Spoilers - sorry!* The first word that sprung to mind whilst watching the film is 'Gremlins'. It's the only critters movie I have seen from the four movies, but I enjoyed it. It wasn't too complicated as I hadn't seen the past two, but I thought it was quite a good movie all the same. <br /><br />Critters starts with a man, his son and daughter stopping off on the way to a vacation (although it turns out that they end up at their own home - which I have no idea what the hell went on) The girl meets up with a boy (played by Leo DiCaprio) and they go hang out in a nearby forest. They meet this weird guy who tells them to be careful and stuff because of the critters. He seems a bit psychotic and if I was in that situation, I would not speak to him. The critters steal a ride of the girl and boy's car and end up in their flat thing. They hide out in the basement and end up killing this lazy jerk. They then nearly kill this fat woman and the girl's dad. They are chased higher and higher up the flat until they hide in the attic. The critters eat stuff in the kitchen (Spoof of the gremlins kitchen scene???!) And I can't remember (not a good thing) but I'm sure they have to go back for something/someone.

6314,"<br /><br />As a fan of bad movies (and MST3K, and a member of MFT3K), I must say I've seen my share of them. But geez! Even the worst I've seen at least had a soundtrack. As George Lazenby stiffly wanders around Hong Kong, doing who knows what, you can guarantee that you won't be distracted by any of that background music that fills todays cinema. Or any of that music that fills elevators. I don't think anyone in this film even hums.<br /><br />Now, this isn't entirely true -- there *is* a sound track. if you listen closely, you will hear it chime in about a half-dozen times through the course of the film. Of course, the timing will be entirely inappropriate, and it doesn't last very long, but something that could be classified as ""music"" does occur. Your best bet, though, is to sit your toddler armed with a wooden spoon down in front of the TV with a collection of pots and pans while you watch. The rhythm and flow would be better than anything the film offers.<br /><br />Keep an eye out for Sammo Hung as a minor villian in this film. Aren't we all glad he found Jackie Chan to work with?",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is scathing in its criticism of the film, focusing primarily on the lack of a decent soundtrack. The reviewer, a self-proclaimed fan of bad movies, expresses disappointment and frustration with the film's silence, joking that even the worst movies they've seen had some form of background music. The reviewer sarcastically notes that the film does have a soundtrack, but it's minimal, poorly timed, and unimpressive. They even suggest that a toddler banging on pots and pans would create a more engaging rhythm than the film's score.

The tone of the review is playful and humorous, with the reviewer using irony and hyperbole to emphasize their point. However, beneath the humor, it's clear that the reviewer is genuinely disappointed and unimpressed with the film. The only positive mention is a brief nod to Sammo Hung's appearance as a minor villain, with the reviewer expressing gratitude that he went on to work with Jackie Chan.

6315,"My first question, is NOT about the horrible acting, NOT about the horrendous writing, it is the directing. The choices that were made about the cinematography are some of this worst decisions I have ever seen. Why does EVERY single bad guy have to die in slow motion? I was about to beat myself with a rubber hose. The camera shots make it so that you can't see whats going on. I was JUST about to turn the movie off because of Jalal Merhi's accent, when it made it to the sex scene, so I thought it might get better, well it did not. If you rate special effects on an A,B,C rating scale, I would have to put it around a W or so, and did I mention the acting? Wow, was it bad!!! And the WORST part of the entire ""Expect to DIE"" experience, is the blatant misuse of the phrase on the cover, which is: ""THE MATRIX JUST GOT DEADLIER"". comparing this movie to the Matrix is easily the WORST comparison I have EVER seen.

6316,"In the wake of the matrix this travesty of a film with loose connections to VR has been reissued with the tag-line ""The Matrix just got Deadler!"", in a box with a very Matrix inspired cover (still called ""Expect to Die"" though).

Jalal Mehri is an awful actor and does not impress with his martial arts. However his partner Stone is played by Evan Lurie, who in this film is simply the worst actor I have ever seen.

The reviewer then proceeds to lambast the film itself, calling it a ""travesty on every level."" The acting is particularly criticized, with Jalal Mehri's martial arts skills deemed unimpressive and his co-star Evan Lurie being labeled the ""worst actor I have ever seen."" The reviewer implies that Lurie's poor performance was intentionally chosen to make Mehri look better by comparison.

6318,"Wow, Jeez, I don't even know where to begin commenting on this thing they called a movie. I seriously don't know what the hell David Bradley began smoking after making Hard Justice, which in my opinion, was quite a good movie after the American Ninja features. I hadn't seen any of this guy's latter movies after Cyborg Cop. Lucky I saw them on Amazon for like 5 pounds each and I can safely say the following: if I had thrown down the drain the 5 pounds I spent on Total Reality, Crisis and Expect to Die, I would have ended up happier than having to sit through the 90 minutes that each of them lasted. My God, how the HECK can anybody label these as ""movies"" ??? And why do action/martial arts actors fall knee-deep into the smelliest horse-dung when they've like reached their peak?? I mean, David Bradley's no Oscar deserver but his first movies were pretty entertaining. Tough, cool guy with pretty good martial expertise who delivered corny lines but at least entertained action and martial arts fans to a certain extent. But I seriously would love to know what went through this guy's head after making Hard Justice. His final 3 movies have to frankly be the WORST I have ever had to sit through. As I mentioned before, I'd love to get my money back on the 3 DVDs I bought. Crisis was the epitome of sleepiness, Total Reality was harsh but this Expect to Die is just utter nonsense. I bet the director was either mega-stoned when he made this or he was just taking the pee out of every David Bradley fan who would sit through this heap of crap. The plot circles around a doctor (Bradley) who develops some type of Virtual Reality game in which he's just killing different people off one by one. Sorry but I just couldn't take this guy seriously playing a baddie with that posh hair-do, glasses and gray slacks and doing absolutely NO physical fighting whatsoever (frankly, his best asset). The film is even worse than any of those Saturday afternoon B-movies because the acting is laughable, the directing is horrendous and the few fights in the movie, well, what can I say... The actors look like they're training with their gym buddy. We get a dumb muscular cop who starts to show off his fighting stuff like one hour into the movie and fails heavily... a french hairy version of Van Damme who just can't fight, act or speak to save his freaking life and Bradley, the supposed protagonist, playing the evil doctor who I was really happy for when he stopped making this type of expendable rubbish. I even reckon he didn't throw a kick in this movie probably due to his heart condition already playing up on him. For a B-actor, I must admit I really liked this guy, his style, physique, fighting skills... But I'm really, really glad he stopped acting after this monstrosity because I honestly wouldn't have been able to sit through another ninety minutes of pee-taking material like this one. Avoid at all costs even if you're family of David Bradley, you'll be glad you did, word.",Negative,Negative,Negative,negative,"This review is an unrelenting and scathing critique of the movie ""Expect to Die"" and, by extension, David Bradley's later filmography. The reviewer's tone is one of utter disgust and disappointment, with a hint of incredulity at how a filmmaker could produce such a terrible movie. The reviewer expresses their shock and dismay at the decline in quality from Bradley's earlier films, which they enjoyed, to these later efforts, which they deem ""the WORST"" they've ever had to sit through.

The reviewer's criticism is multifaceted, targeting the film's plot, acting, directing, and fight choreography. They ridicule the plot as nonsensical, the acting as laughable, and the directing as horrendous. The reviewer is particularly disappointed that Bradley, an actor known for his martial arts skills, does not engage in any physical fighting in the movie. The reviewer's use of strong language, such as ""utter nonsense,"" ""heap of crap,"" and ""pee-taking material,"" underscores their intense dislike for the film.

The reviewer's conclusion is unequivocal: avoid this movie at all costs, even if you're a fan of David Bradley. The reviewer's tone is so negative that it's clear they would not recommend this film to anyone.

Why would you ever consider giving this pile of horse **** a 10. You can say it's worth a 10 for the sheer comedy of it but when you vote on a movie that's not supposed to be a comedy you can't give it a 10 for comedy.

6327,"Gene Hackman is a former Marine Corps colonel who musters a handful of private Vietnam vets to go back to Laos and rescue some Americans who have been listed as missing in action. Hackman suspects that, in actuality, the half-dozen or so MIAs are secretly being held in a remote camp by Laotians to be tormented and to provide more hard labor. Hackman is being paid by the wealthy Robert Stack, whose son, like Hackman's son, is thought to be among the MIAs. But the circumstances are such that Hackman can only manage to buy old and out-dated weapons, though he manages to pick up the help of a fervid anti-communist Loatian and his two daughters along the way.<br /><br />I don't think the movie was deliberately concocted to endorse the myth of the Vietnames still holding our MIAs for propaganda purposes. The myth was real enough. If anyone remembers, there were many bumper stickers in 1982 and 1983, BRING BACK THE MIAs. I think, instead, that the film was made partly in order to cash in on the myth. It was absurd on the face of it. Why would our former enemy refuse to return MIAs? Propaganda? Where is the propaganda value in something that's kept secret? To add the labor supply? They need a hundred extra laborers in Vietnam and Laos? The motives behind this movie -- with its triumphant music and high body count -- were scurrilous.<br /><br />But how about the movie itself? Stripped of its theme of rescuing mythical mistreated MIAs, it's a routine paramilitary actioner, no better and no worse than dozens of others that appeared in the 1980s. Gene Hackman's performance is the only one that manages to keep its head above water. He's just about always reliable.<br /><br />Of the others, this being a formulaic plot, derived from ""The Dirty Dozen"" among others, I kept trying to guess which of the gang would sacrifice themselves for the mission. Of the three anti-communist Asians, I figured one or more were dead meat. That's why Asian helpers appear in movies like this. (I was right two times out of three.) I also figured Patrick Swayzie as the rookie ex-officer, the youngest of the group, who'd never ""earned the respect"" of the others because he'd never seen combat, would also have to go in some heroic mode. Wrong. He becomes a hero, true, but survives intact. I thought there was a fifty-fifty chance that Hackman would have to go too, but he makes it out okay. The formula doesn't really stretch for originality either. Charles Bronson's claustrophobic POW escapee from ""The Great Escape"" is here in Fred Ward's ex tunnel rat, a claustrophobe who is forced to crawl through a drainage pipe with a snake inside it, so that he can do a recon on the Laotian POW camp.<br /><br />The title, ""Uncommon Valor,"" is from a tribute that Admiral Nimitz made to the men on Iwo Jima -- ""Uncommon valor was common that day."" Nimitz was certainly right about that. Whether or not the men who fought in Vietnam were all equally valorous is remote from the point. Anyone who saw combat or even came near it, putting their lives on the line for the guys in the line next to them, were heroic enough. This movie, and the way it exploits our bitterness about the Vietnam war, doesn't really do them justice.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is predominantly negative, criticizing the film ""Uncommon Valor"" for its perceived exploitation of the myth of American MIAs in Vietnam and its formulaic, unoriginal plot. The reviewer argues that the film's premise, centered around rescuing supposedly mistreated MIAs, is absurd and likely motivated by a desire to cash in on the popular myth of the time. The reviewer also criticizes the film's reliance on familiar action movie tropes, such as the sacrificial Asian helpers and the heroic rookie officer. The only redeeming aspect of the film, according to the reviewer, is Gene Hackman's performance, which manages to stand out amidst the formulaic plot.

The reviewer's tone is critical and dismissive, implying that the film is more interested in exploiting audience emotions and perpetuating a myth than in telling a genuine, respectful story about the Vietnam War.

6328,"I know these types of films sell tickets and make a profit for the film makers but it just won't do as a film about Vietnam. Viet Nam was filled with horrors for the men who lived it day in and day out.<br /><br />This film stars Gene Hackman who is Korean war vet assigned to train a group of rag-tag Viet Nam Vets for a return trip to that country to rescue a group of American POW's held at a camp there. These men include a former tunnel rat, a crazy acid dropping sailor, a blond tanned surfer from California and some inexperienced kid (Patrick Swayze) who just so happens had a dad that was killed in Nam. They train first at some camp in Texas and once in Nam they are found out and lose all their weapons. They are able to find replacement weapons and continue on their way to free the captured men. Most of the men are found and saved but the rag-tag group is mostly wiped out.<br /><br />This movie played like a video game in which you could figure out what was going to happen next and who would pop out of behind what bush, and who was going to die and who was going to live. Viet Nam I'm guessing was not like a video game....",Negative,Negative,Negative,negative,"This review is largely negative, expressing disappointment and frustration with the film's portrayal of the Vietnam War. The reviewer argues that the film oversimplifies and trivializes the harsh realities of the war, reducing it to a predictable and formulaic action-adventure narrative. The reviewer criticizes the film's reliance on familiar tropes, such as the ""rag-tag"" team of misfits, and the predictable plot twists, likening it to a video game. The reviewer also expresses frustration that the film does not adequately convey the horrors and complexities of the Vietnam War, implying that the film is more concerned with entertainment value than with accurately portraying the experiences of those who lived through the war.

The reviewer's tone is one of disappointment and disillusionment, suggesting that the film fails to do justice to the subject matter. The reviewer's criticism is not just about the film's artistic merits but also about its failure to respectfully represent the experiences of those who served in Vietnam. The reviewer's final sentence, ""Viet Nam I'm guessing was not like a video game…"", drives home the point that the film's portrayal of the war is inaccurate and insensitive.

6331,"It is sad to have to say that a film is truly awful and one tries to find ways around saying this. However, this is a dreadful film. Gene Hackman wastes time (and one suspects, many dollars) on re-playing his most famous, and oft recreated, role as ""Gene Hackman"". Otherwise, television actors are given the chance to become film stars, and successfully, resist the temptation.

6335,"This movie has got to be one of the all-time lows of Michael J. Fox's generally respectable career. I should have known how awful this movie was when I rented it and found the movie only half viewed and not rewound by the previous renter. Never a good sign! Fox plays a grown up child star who's now an agent for other show business kids. His character is delusional in that he still believes that everyone should love him for being Mikey. His big break comes when he meets Angie Vega, a talented child. Vega is abrasive and not at all likeable.

6337,"Another sadistic and ultra-sleazy late 70's/early 80's revenge movie?? Wes Craven sure launched a popular trend with his ""Last House on the Left"" Although ""Terror Express"" is more like a rip-off of other rip-offs, like ""I Spit on your Grave"" and especially ""Night Train Murders"". Storywise, this movie has absolutely nothing new to offer so the only thing left to do for director Ferdinando Baldi was to multiply the sleaze-factor by a thousand! This is actually just a soft core porn flick that gets a little bit rough near the ending. On the night train from Rome are three hopelessly imbecile loser running amok. They provoke the male travelers and sexually harass the females. Things get a little out of control and a traveling convict comes to the rescue of a prostitute who keeps being screwed around by the three. This is a very tame movie and there wasn't even enough budget to buy a couple bags of fake blood. This type of movies is generally infamous for the brutal rape sequences and the discriminating behavior towards women, but the sex in ""Terror Express"" isn't unsettling at all. On the contrary, these 'rapists' spend more time orally pleasuring their victims then getting some themselves! The music is great, the dialogs are unintentionally hilarious and the characters are the most ridiculous ones I ever beheld. The villains are wimps and the train-passengers are so motionless they look like part of the set. If you like your exploitation as sleazy as it gets, this is your film. However, your hunger for blood and controversy will definitely not be stilled.

The reviewer acknowledges that the film is part of a popular trend of revenge movies, but criticizes it for being a rip-off of other films and lacking originality in its storyline. The reviewer also expresses disappointment that the film fails to deliver on its promise of brutality and controversy, instead opting for a more tame and soft-core approach. The review does acknowledge some positive aspects, such as the music and unintentionally humorous dialogue, but these are not enough to redeem the film's overall lack of impact.

The reviewer's tone is often sarcastic and mocking, implying that the film is more of a soft-core porn flick than a genuine horror or thriller. The criticism of the film's portrayal of women and its treatment of sexual violence is also notable, with the reviewer implying that the film's approach is problematic and exploitative.

6338,"The unpleasant ""home invasion"" genre can be traced back to Wes Craven's early sleazefest ""Last House On The Left"", with such nasty off-shoots as ""I Spit On Your Grave"", ""Wrong Way"" and ""The Visitors"" soon following in the footsteps of that film. Here, in this early '80s Italian offering the same plot is regurgitated once more, with the twist being that this one is set on a continental train. ""La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto""  known in English-speaking countries as ""Terror Express""  starts out surprisingly well but about twenty minutes in it takes a turn for the worse, as the sex scenes start to gain precedence over the more serious action and suspense.<br /><br />David, Phil and Ernie, three rich youths who wallow in terrorising and humiliating others, board a trans-continental express in Italy. The train is full of other passengers, among them prostitute Juliette (Silvia Dionisio) who rides the train frequently and has struck up a deal with one of the porters to act as a kind of pimp, persuading the male passengers to part with their cash for a night of passion in her sleeping compartment. The three cretins quickly set about upsetting the passengers with their aggressive, drunken behaviour, but matters get more serious when they seize control of an entire car on the express and barricade themselves in from the rest of the train. Pretty soon, they are revelling in their temporary control. a young wife (Zora Kerova) is raped by two of the youths in a cramped compartment; Juliette herself is subjected to a prolonged sexual assault; and later the odious trio force the male passengers to role a dice in order to decide which one will rape a 16 year old virgin travelling with her parents (a concept made doubly tasteless by the fact that her father is one of the men forced to play the game). The only passenger who seems prepared to fight back is a convict who is being escorted to Germany, but what hope does one man have against three armed thugs? <br /><br />La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto gets off to a decent start. Various intriguing characters are introduced, and the three hoodlums are shown to have a genuinely unsettling influence over the travellers. Though the story is clearly the stuff of exploitation, the opening scenes are built up carefully and the film seems to be rising above the usual gutter-level of its genre. Things fall apart during a horrid scene in which Kerova is sex-sandwiched in a toilet compartment by two of the thugs. The scene is gloatingly filmed, and the effect does not seem to be to generate sympathy for the victim or hatred towards the perpetrators instead, we are being asked to feel turned on. This is sensationalism at its worst. Further humiliating rapes follow, but the rape sequences involve too much lingering camera work over acts of oral sex and the female genitalia. One sequence featuring the 16 year old girl teeters on the brink of hard core and feels particularly ""wrong"". By the end of La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto it is easy to forget that it was intended as a thriller, for the final hour of the film is dedicated to pornography rather than suspense. Lovers of sleaze will revel in it; others might want to look elsewhere.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is largely negative, criticizing the film ""Terror Express"" (also known as ""La Ragazza Del Vagone Letto"") for its exploitative and sensationalist approach to depicting sexual violence and rape. The reviewer acknowledges that the film starts off well, introducing intriguing characters and building tension, but soon devolves into gratuitous and explicit scenes of sexual assault. The reviewer argues that these scenes are not intended to generate sympathy for the victims or hatred towards the perpetrators, but rather to titillate the audience, making the film feel more like pornography than a thriller.

The reviewer's tone is one of disgust and disappointment, condemning the film's objectification of women and its apparent goal of arousing the audience rather than telling a suspenseful story. The review concludes by warning readers that the film is not suitable for those seeking a genuine thriller, but rather caters to fans of exploitative and sensationalist content.

6339,"I've got to say, I'm a big fan of these 'Last House on the Left' rip-offs, even the ones that most people seem to hate are often held in relatively high esteem by me; but one of these sorts of films that I didn't like much was Aldo Lado's 'Night Train Murders', and unfortunately it would seem that trains and The Last House on the Left don't mix, as Terror Express is another lacklustre rip-off. Something that this sort of film really needs is a resoundingly nasty lead character; and while Terror Express offers up three potential candidates, not one of them steps up and becomes this villain, leaving the lacking in the most important area. It actually gets off to a good start as three young men on a passenger train begin slightly irritating the guests on board. This leads the audience to believe that there is more in store, but unfortunately it never really gets going once the scene has been set. From there, the trio end up 'taking over' the train and use their new found power to terrorise the guests and rape the women.<br /><br />It has to be said that there's a fair amount of sleaze in this film, which will be pleasing to many viewers; but there's hardly any blood. Director Ferdinando Baldi seemed to think that he could get away with replacing the blood with sex scenes, and he may have gotten away with it too; if he could film a brutal sex scene. The idea that these men have taken the train by force goes out of the window once it gets to the sex, as the people that you would expect to be powerful and forceful seem all too keen to show their women a good time, and despite one very tame 'sandwich' sequence, none of the sex is particularly interesting. Since a lot of the film is taken up by these sex scenes, this becomes a massive problem. Films like this are often lacking in style, suspense and credibility; but you know you're watching a bad one when it's boring you. As you might expect, none of the acting is up to anything; and the central three in particular stand out for being rubbish. The direction is lacking in style, and there's very little tension or suspense; making it difficult to care what is going to happen.

While the film starts off well, it quickly loses momentum and becomes dull, relying too heavily on uninteresting sex scenes that lack brutality and intensity. The reviewer also criticizes the acting, direction, and overall style of the film, stating that it lacks suspense, tension, and credibility.

6340,"La Ragazza del Vagone Letto, or Terror Express! as it was called on the version I saw, starts as various passengers board a long distance train. Three thuggish idiots, Dave, Phil & Ernie (Carlo De Mejo) board & it's clear that they're there to cause trouble as they intimidate & verbally abuse the other passengers & staff. As the train speeds along things turn nasty when a prostitute named Juliette (Silvia Dionisio) refuses to have sex with Dave, he & his mates decide to hold the entire train hostage so they can have an orgy with Juliette &, well not much else actually happens apart from some hero cop & his prisoner who set about saving the day. Erm, that's it really...<br /><br />This Italian production was directed by Ferdinando Baldi & is complete total & utter crap from start to finish. The script by George Eastman as Luigi Montefiori could just as easily be described as a really boring porno as much as a horror/thriller. It is tediously slow, it's 35 minutes before anything even remotely sleazy happens & as a whole the film lacks the sort of exploitation elements that Italian sleaze & horror was delivering at that time. The film can be compared to another Italian production the infinitely better The House on the Edge of the Park (1980) made the same year, it's a very broad comparison though as everything that made The House on the Edge of the Park the notorious film that it is is absent from La Ragazza del Vagone Letto, there's no blood, no gore, almost no violence, there's only a couple of really tame rapes, the story has no twists or turns & as it's incredibly boring to watch. Italian sleaze & horror from the late 70's & early 80's isn't known for it's strong story lines or great scripts but this films really does scrape the bottom-of-the-barrel on all counts. The character's are awful, the film spends the first 30 plus minutes building them up & giving some background as to why they're on the train but this is all quickly forgotten & comes to absolutely nothing. I hated the lame ending as well & I don't know if I missed something but was any sort of reasonable explanation given as to why these three lamebrains would hijack a train? I don't think there was, was there? I'm sorry but because your angry at a prostitute is not enough of a reason, surely the filmmakers could have come up with something a bit more substantial & interesting if not more plausible. In my opinion this film stinks, it's as simple & straight forward as that I'm afraid.<br /><br />Director Baldi does an OK job, to be fair he only has one corridor & a few train compartments to work with so I'll cut him some slack, having said that the film does become very repetitive. There is no style & he films the sex scenes like a bad soft core porno complete with awful romantic sounding piano music. There is NOT ONE SINGLE DROP OF BLOOD SPILT IN THE ENTIRE FILM, that's right not one single drop. Forget about any gore or violence as you'll be very disappointed if you do, like I did. There are a couple of rapes but they're amateurishly staged & have zero impact, the nasty exploitation & sleaze of say I Spit on Your Grave (1978) or The Last House on the Left (1972) is not here.<br /><br />Technically La Ragazza del Vagone Letto is OK & it's quite well made on what must have been a low budget but the setting obviously helped keep the cost down to a minimum. The acting is poor as usual, although since it was dubbed the original performances have been lost. Fans of Italian horror will recognise a lot of the voices here.<br /><br />La Ragazza del Vagone Letto is a terrible film, it's just my opinion but I was bored to tears waiting for something to happen & when it eventually never I felt cheated, I want those 80 minutes of my life back. This piece of crap isn't even fit to grace the 99p VHS bargain bin in your local Blockbuster, one to avoid.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing strong disappointment and frustration with the film ""La Ragazza del Vagone Letto"" (also known as ""Terror Express"").

The reviewer argues that the film lacks the exploitation elements, violence, and gore that are typical of Italian horror and sleaze films of the late 1970s and early 1980s.

The reviewer also criticizes the film's pacing, calling it ""tediously slow"" and stating that nothing remotely interesting happens until 35 minutes into the film. The characters are described as ""awful"", and the reviewer expresses frustration with the lack of twists or turns in the story. The ending is also panned, with the reviewer calling it ""lame"" and questioning the motivations of the hijackers.

The only faint praise offered is for the director, Ferdinando Baldi, who is given some credit for working with a limited setting and budget. However, even this praise is tempered by criticism of the film's repetitive nature and poor handling of sex scenes.

The film was shot for very little money on video. Off course then it doesn't look as good as a normal film, duh! The one thing I do agree on is that the music is bad.

The film is not good, okay, but you have to give some credit for pulling this of without any money.",Negative,Negative,Negative,negative,"This review presents a mixed assessment of the film, but ultimately leans towards a negative evaluation. The reviewer begins by expressing confusion at the extreme opinions of others, implying that the film is neither exceptional nor terrible. They acknowledge that the acting, aside from De Kok, is acceptable, but the script is the primary issue. The characters are deemed unconvincing, and the psychological motivations behind their actions are unclear. The reviewer also criticizes the film's visuals, but attributes this to the low budget and use of video, implying that it's unfair to expect high production values under these circumstances.

The reviewer's tone is somewhat defensive, as they seem to be arguing that the film's shortcomings are understandable given its limited resources. However, this defense is not enough to redeem the film's overall quality, and the reviewer ultimately concludes that the film ""is not good."" The only aspect that receives universal criticism is the music, which is likened to a cheap, 1980s-style soft erotic film score.

Despite the reviewer's attempts to provide context and understanding, the negative comments and criticisms outweigh the faint praise, leading to a predominantly negative assessment.

6343,"I caught this movie on late-night TV. Honestly i saw most of it, and the whole time i was sitting in complete and utter disbelief.<br /><br />Is there any genre that's more pointless than soft-core porn? If there is i don't want to know about it. Softcore porn combines all the horrors of porn (lousy production values, abominable acting, crappy scripts) with the coyness of sex-scenes in regular movies. So the end result is arousing nor entertaining. This movie also has the rather odd approach of a science-fiction setting, and it works horribly. All the sex is performed in some sort of virtual reality setting where the crew from the future learn about physical love. And yes, it's about as confused and silly as it sounds.<br /><br />But there has to be some positive points though, right? Well, there is one... Krista Allen is amazingly hot. That's about the only thing that was less than awful in this movie. I don't know what it is about her, but she has an amazing sex appeal. The rest of the cast look like the standard porn-cast though. Rather unattractive women with poorly done fake breasts, and men that have spent far too much time in the gym toning themselves grotesque. Probably a gym in Germany as well judging by haircuts and clothing.<br /><br />To sum things up. If you enjoy Krista Allens presence on screen you can watch this for the brief moments where she shows some of her seductive potential (most of the time she tries to articulate crappy lines of dialog though). If you don't enjoy Krista Allen then you might as well stay away altogether.<br /><br />I rate this 10/10 for Krista Allens sex appeal, 1/10 for everything else and 2/10 for entertainment value since this is a unique crappy porn/science fiction hybrid that's not really like anything i've ever seen.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is largely negative, with the reviewer expressing disbelief and disappointment with the movie.

This movie involves little imagination whatsoever. While I do have a good laugh at it's stupidity, and perhaps I'll buy it myself, I am but a fool. Rent before you buy on this one. 2 out of 10.

6345,"I just have to comment on this movie because I gave it a 4 rating, and in my opinion that's pretty high for a softporn smut movie. The actual plot is kind of hokey (who would expect otherwise) but Hafron is so incredibly funny, and he delivers everything in a cyborgish voice so it's easy for him. Whoever wrote the script had some wit definitely! I must have laughed out loud ten times, and that's not a reason anyone would pick up this movie. The only softporn movie I've seen which had any merit other than beautiful women (and believe me, Emmanuelle is drop dead gorgeous...just look at the cover!)<br /><br />Any movie that can entertain me considering how poor the plot was and how bad the acting is, also considering the movie wasn't made to artistically entertain, so to speak, it gets at least a four in my book.

The reviewer acknowledges the film's shortcomings, calling it a ""softporn smut movie"" with a ""hokey"" plot and poor acting. However, they also highlight the film's redeeming qualities, particularly the comedic performance of Hafron, who delivers his lines in a ""cyborgish voice"" that adds to the humor. The reviewer praises the script's wit and notes that they laughed out loud multiple times, which is unexpected given the film's genre and intentions.

The reviewer's tone is tongue-in-cheek, and they seem to be amused by the film's camp value. They acknowledge that the film's primary appeal lies in its titillating content, but also appreciate its ability to entertain despite its flaws. The comparison to other films, such as ""Stop!

6346,"If you read the plot summary for ""Mad Max,"" you've just ruined the first 1 hour and 10 minutes of the film. You've also found out that ""Mad Max"" takes place in post-apocalyptic Australia, which will be helpful because otherwise you won't have any idea what's going on. The film, made in 1979, tries really hard to be Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971) only that film, in all its strangeness, actually makes sense and leaves an impact. This film does neither and ends up being a car/bike stunt-filled romp that crashes like every vehicle in the film does.<br /><br />The first thing wrong with ""Mad Max"" is that it tries to sell itself as a revenge tale when no vigilante appears to take revenge until the final 20 minutes. If the first hour were condensed to 20-30 minutes and then the final 20 added on and then another hour added after that, ""Mad Max would be a cool action film with a great vigilante protagonist. Instead, Mel Gibson has to wait around and act like a sissy for 2/3 of the film and then have a sudden epiphany to seek revenge. I've yet to watch the sequel ""Road Warrior"" and I have to admit I'm excited for it only because I want to know what he does next. This first film was mostly a waste of time.<br /><br />George Miller does some great action stuff here, but his over-the-top symbolism is absurd and the unbearable cheesy reaction sequences every time a character discovers something horrifying like a burnt hand or what have you completely ruins those moments. Its a terribly cliché B-movie technique.<br /><br />There is absolutely no thematic value or subtle critique of society in this film no matter what you might think. A great action sci-fi movie at least makes a point, but the gratuitous violence done by random, weird bikers doesn't say anything of value. Even the villain Toecutter feels modeled off Alex of ""Clockwork"" only uglier and completely unimposing. The PG violence just does not allow the violence of this gang to settle in and get a reaction from the viewer, it just cheeses it up if anything.<br /><br />I'll give credit for the amount of stuff the film crew blew up and crashed into things and Miller does a great job making you feel the intensity of the collisions. Everything else is mediocre at best and then after an hour of mediocrity, you get something good and the film ends 20 minutes later. I'm just crossing my fingers ""Road Warrior"" will fulfill the expectations of where this film ends, otherwise that's more time wasted. ~Steven C<br /><br />Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with the film ""Mad Max"".

6347,"Ok, where to start. I can't believe how many good reviews I read on here. I watched this (year 2004) and I had to fight to not push the stop button, I decided to continue just because of all the good reviews I read. After watching it I felt it was my duty to let the world know about this. First of all the movie seems like it is never going to begin, the plotline doesn't actually occur until about 30 minutes before the movie ends, leaving the viewer wondering, `when is this going to start' So don't ever call this a `revenge movie' because the revenge doesn't even start until over half the movie is already gone by. Furthermore, the movie tries to make you believe this is a post-apocalyptic Australia. I am sorry if showing dusty rural roads half the movie and a crooked letter on a sign didn't quite convince me of that, even for 1979 this was not science fiction. So anyways, add this on top of randomly placed homoerotic subtext and you have got yourself one crappy movie (I have nothing against gays, there was just no need for it). The only good part was the first chase scene, good directing considering it was 1979, and another good part is how he kills the last guy. So basically I recommend you watch the first 10 minutes and last 5 minutes and you will enjoy yourself much more than if you sat through all that stuff in the middle, which may lead you to gouge your own eyes out. Don't say I didn't warn you.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing frustration and disappointment with the film. The reviewer's primary complaint is that the plot takes too long to develop, with the main storyline not kicking in until the last 30 minutes of the movie. This leads to a sense of boredom and disengagement, as the viewer is left wondering when the plot will finally start. The reviewer also criticizes the film's attempt to create a post-apocalyptic atmosphere, which they find unconvincing. Additionally, they express discomfort with the inclusion of homoerotic subtext, which they deem unnecessary.

The reviewer does acknowledge a few positive aspects, such as the well-directed first chase scene and the final confrontation. However, these brief moments of praise are vastly outweighed by the reviewer's overall dissatisfaction with the film. The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and warning, as they advise readers to only watch the first 10 minutes and last 5 minutes, implying that the rest of the movie is not worth sitting through.

6348,"George Segal lives with his elderly and senile mother. There are many jokes about her Alzheimer's-like dementia and most of them aren't funny, though there were a few funny moments sprinkled in here and there (such as the nude running through the park scene and the old folks home). At first, Segal tries to kill his mother because she's tough to live with and because he's a selfish guy. Making the film sort of like a Wiley Coyote versus the Roadrunner comedy where he tries again and again to kill this indestructible gal would have been a hoot--too bad this was NOT the overall tone of the film.<br /><br />I do applaud Carl Reiner's attempt to make a tasteless film that is intended to offend everyone. I have a special place in my heart for films like ED AND HIS DEAD MOTHER, EATING RAOUL and HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS--all films about death that dare to offend. The problem here, though, is that WHERE'S POPPA? has some funny moments, but it also has a lot of flat ones and the overall product is amazingly bland. Plus topics such as homosexual rape, incest and the like are really difficult to make funny. I read in ""THE ROUGH GUIDE TO CULT MOVIES"" that it is considered a cult film, though I just can't see anyone wanting to see this more than once.",Negative,Negative,Negative,negative,"This review is mixed, but ultimately leans towards a negative assessment of the film ""Where's Poppa?"". The reviewer acknowledges that the film has some funny moments, such as the nude running scene and the old folks home scene, but notes that these moments are scattered and not enough to redeem the film as a whole. The reviewer also praises the director's attempt to create a tasteless film that offends everyone, which suggests an appreciation for irreverent and provocative humor.

However, the reviewer's criticism of the film's tone and execution is more prominent. They express disappointment that the film doesn't fully commit to a Wiley Coyote-esque tone, which would have made the film more enjoyable. Instead, the reviewer finds the film to be bland and inconsistent, with too many flat moments. The reviewer also notes that the film's attempts to tackle sensitive topics like homosexual rape and incest fall flat and are not funny.

Overall, while the reviewer appreciates the film's irreverent spirit, they are disappointed by its execution and find it to be a mediocre film that is not worth repeated viewings.

6349,"New York attorney plots to rid himself of his senile mother after meeting an attractive, available woman. Screenwriter Robert Klane, adapting his own novel (the kind of paperback kids would buy for the dirty parts), doesn't seem to have any knowledge of mental illness: to him, it's just an excuse for prurient comedy and scatological jokes. George Segal--who, in the 1960s, starred mostly in war and espionage pictures--had become, by this time, one of America's greatest sad-sack comedians; his nutty reactions and batty responses rival only his mother's inscrutabilities. Segal is paired well with Trish Van Devere, and their moments of connection (though also played for laughs) are really the only sequences one can gravitate towards. Ruth Gordon, lovable as is she, is simply around too much--and more of her amounts to less. This is one of the worst directed and edited films I have ever seen from so-called professionals. Promising scenes which ultimately don't play out for the full effect are haphazardly disconnected from other moments which flail around endlessly, causing the crass, rickety movie to self-destruct long before it's actually over. *1/2 from ****",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is largely negative, criticizing the film's approach to mental illness, its direction, and editing. The reviewer accuses the screenwriter of using mental illness as a plot device for cheap comedy and scatological humor, demonstrating a lack of understanding of the subject matter. While the reviewer praises George Segal's comedic performance, calling him one of America's greatest sad-sack comedians, they also criticize the overexposure of Ruth Gordon's character, which they find tiresome. The reviewer's strongest criticism is aimed at the film's direction and editing, describing it as one of the worst they've seen from professionals. They lament that promising scenes fail to deliver and are disconnected from other moments, causing the film to fall apart.

The only positive aspect mentioned is the chemistry between Segal and Trish Van Devere, which provides some enjoyable moments. However, this is not enough to redeem the film's numerous flaws. The reviewer's tone is scathing, and their 1.5-star rating out of four underscores their disappointment and frustration with the film.

6350,"I was prepared to love ""Where's Poppa"", it features the nexus of Normal Lear sitcom character actors who, when I was growing up, felt like extended members of my raisenette-sized broken nuclear family. How fun it would be to see censor-free Barnard Hughes, Vincent Gardenia, Ron Liebman, Rob Reiner, and a pre-SNL Garret Morris.<br /><br />But alas,""Where's Poppa"" drags. It's claustrophobic and plodding, and breaks the cardinal rules of farce, lightness of mood and a fast pace.<br /><br />The plot involves the efforts of a lawyer (George Segal) to rid himself of his overbearing Jewish mother, who lives in his gigantic New York apartment. Along the way we are exposed ridiculous characters and situations: a comedic group of muggers who repeatedly mug the brother of the main character, the rape of a policeman which involving a gorilla suit and subsequent gay love, Ruth Gorden pulling down Segal's pants and biting his ass as he serves her dinner. Why doesn't this work? Part of the explanation is the sense of doom engendered by the cramped, dark interiors and antique set-decoration. I absolutely eat up cinematography of New York during this era, but watching this movie felt like I was leafing through the Police Gazette in a dark bus terminal.<br /><br />The main reason though is the slow pace. Modern MTV-style quick cuts have changed what moviegoers feel is a comfortable editing tempo, but, even taking this into consideration, camera shots are held for an excessively long time. Plot developments are also very slow. There is one situation in which this works: a weird love song George Segal sings to Trish Van Devere, softly, very close to her face, and for an excruciatingly long period of time. It reminded me of those cringeworthy extended shots in the British version of ""The Office"", where you find yourself mentally begging the camera to cut away, and at the same time you can't stop looking.<br /><br />Sadly, most of the film is more ""hurry up"" than ""can't look away"". Which made me wonder if it's possible to have a black comedy that is also a farce. The dilemma is that the gravitas of the subject matter in a black comedy tends to weigh down lightness of the farce. Movies like Robert Altman's ""M*A*S*H"" and Kubrick's ""Dr. Strangelove"" prove that it can be accomplished. They do this not only through speed but also through entertaining subplots, something ""Where's Poppa"" neglects.<br /><br />Although the film features multiple, stereotypically-funny characters, almost all of them are directly involved in the central drama of how to deal with the recalcitrant mother. The scenes featuring Garret Morris and the Central Park muggers are as close as the viewer gets to a mental break. The muggers seemed almost Shakespearean, following the tradition of comic ne'er-d0-wells. If the rest of ""Where's Poppa"" had clung a little more closely to stage tradition it would have been a better film. Edgier isn't always better. It's as if all these talented actors and the director Carl Reiner, were taking a short before the creative maelstrom of the 70's .<br /><br />Random notes: After strealing Ron Liebman's clothes, the muggers mention Cornel Wilde's ""The Naked Prey"" (1966), a great action movie that was a stylistic precursor to 1968's ""Planet of the Apes"".<br /><br />As politically incorrect as he was, it's disquieting to learn about the death of an action hero as formidable as Charleton Heston. Linda Harrison, who played ""Nova"", Taylor's mute mate, said that James Fransicus, in the sequel seemed to be cute and tiny compared to Heston.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review of ""Where's Poppa"" is largely negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with the film's pacing, tone, and overall execution. Despite featuring a talented cast of character actors, the reviewer finds the film to be ""claustrophobic and plodding,"" with a slow pace that drags down the viewing experience. The reviewer criticizes the film's failure to balance its dark humor with a lighthearted, farcical tone, citing the influence of cinematography and set decoration in creating a sense of doom and gloom.

The reviewer also laments the lack of entertaining subplots and the film's inability to effectively balance its black comedy with farcical elements, citing successful examples like ""M*A*S*H"" and ""Dr. Strangelove."" The few redeeming moments, such as a cringe-worthy love song scene, are not enough to salvage the film's overall shortcomings. The reviewer concludes that the film's edginess and attempts at darkness ultimately detract from its potential as a farce, and that a more traditional, stage-inspired approach might have yielded better results.

6351,"In the opening sequence of ""Where's Poppa?"", George Segal rises from his bed one morning, shaves, showers, puts on a gorilla suit and goes into his mother's bedroom, we realize later, to give her a massive heart attack that will kill her and get her out of his life forever. This is about the level of humor one can expect from most of this picture: insanity, blended with what might be taken as morbid daring.<br /><br />Segal plays a New York attorney who lives with his supposedly senile mother (Ruth Gordon), whose life is further complicated when, while hiring a nurse to care for the old bag, meets the girl of his dreams, the pleasantly prim Trish Van Devere, decked out like Florence Nightingale. His dilemma: how to integrate the lovely nurse into his and his pesky mother's life.<br /><br />Segal's performance is about the only thing holding the picture together. His frustrations, his reactions, his comic timing is almost peerless (whatever happened to that guy?); where the film fails is in other areas. Ruth Gordon's characterization is dreadful as the mother. At the beginning, you can't figure out if her character is senile or just being deliberately vague to keep her son from moving out. By the end, it's clear she's just nuts. When Segal brings Van Devere home to meet her, Gordon's eyebrows furrow and she gets a mean, sinister look. She wants the intruder in her son's life removed; she's calculating. This is not the mode of a senile person. You're not getting a consistent performance throughout the picture, which is probably the director's (Carl Reiner) fault as much as Gordon's. Ruth Gordon's old lady in ""Rosemary Baby"" is much more successful because with the kind of ingratiating, cloying person that Ruth Gordon generally plays, the audience responds to her as annoying. But when Mia Farrow is too timid to fight back, Gordon becomes more cloying, her fangs dig deeper and deeper and we're frightened for Farrow; this kind of imposition is genuinely terrifying. Here, we're being asked to laugh at what we'd normally find annoying, and if Gordon played it as helplessly nutty all the way, we might. But she's selfish and mean as well, and it dampens what little humor there is.<br /><br />There are a few good laughs, though. A courtroom scene with Barnard Hughes as a military officer and Rob Reiner as a counterculture punk is fairly hilarious, and Vincent Gardenia does a nice turn as a Lombardiesque football coach. There's also an inspired bit where Segal's brother (Ron Liebman), having been stripped naked by muggers on his way to Segal's place, asks him for something for to wear home- and he gives him the gorilla suit.<br /><br />But of a lot of the script is poorly conceived and simply doesn't make sense. Why is a New York lawyer with his own practice even living at home in the first place? Why does Segal, if his mother is senile, try to reason with her logically: ""If you spoil this for me, I'll punch your f---ing heart out."" Why does Liebman keep cutting through the park if he knows he's going to get mugged? Why does he take a taxi after leaving Segal's with gorilla suit? Why wasn't he taking taxis all along? A funnier bit would have been Liebman, as the gorilla, terrorizing the muggers. Why does Van Devere keep coming back- after her first husband was a kook, why does she want to get involved with this bunch? I suppose if I put this to Carl Reiner, he'd say, 'These are crazy people, they don't have to make sense.' Which is a convenient way to excuse a lousy script that's full of holes. The characters' moment-to-moment behavior may not have to make sense, but their motivations do, and that's where ""Where's Poppa?"" falls apart; the situations are created just to have the gag, and the gags are mostly one-shots, they don't build to anything.<br /><br />Carl Reiner is the most guilty in this whole fiasco. How he has acquired this vaunted reputation as a pillar of comedy puzzles me; basically, his career has been to hold a microphone in front of Sid Caesar and Mel Brooks while they talk in funny voices. His son Rob has ten times the skill and intelligence as a director. In show-biz terms, Reiner pushes buttons; a monkey could do his job. And that is most apparent in his framing of the action. Why is all of New York shot in tight and in close-ups, but the scenes in the country are all distant and panoramic? That's the mentality of Carl Reiner's direction, claustrophobic for the city, spatial for the country. In the final lunatic scene at the old folks home, the camera is so far off, you can't even make out what's going on. The abrupt ending suggests a resolution that Segal could have easily arrived at ninety minutes ago; it also suggests Reiner couldn't figure out how to end the picture. So he just cut it, as another example of ""craziness"". Reiner seems to think dumbness equals craziness, and craziness without logic is always funny. It isn't, and the creators of ""Where's Poppa"" are as demented as Ruth Gordon putting Pepsi in her Fruit Loops.",Negative,negative,negative,negative,"This review is largely negative, criticizing the film ""Where's Poppa?"" for its inconsistencies, poor script, and lack of logic in its narrative. The reviewer praises George Segal's performance, noting his excellent comic timing, but finds fault with Ruth Gordon's portrayal of the mother, which is deemed inconsistent and unconvincing. The reviewer also criticizes the director, Carl Reiner, for his handling of the film, suggesting that he relies on cheap gags and lacks a coherent vision.

The review highlights several issues with the script, including plot holes, illogical character motivations, and a lack of coherence in the narrative. The reviewer argues that the film's humor is not effective, as it relies on one-shot gags rather than building towards a larger comedic payoff. The review also criticizes Reiner's direction, suggesting that he lacks skill and intelligence as a filmmaker.

Despite some positive comments about individual scenes and performances, the review is overwhelmingly negative, concluding that the film is a ""fiasco"" and that Carl Reiner is not a skilled director.

The reviewer criticizes the script for trying to shock the audience rather than genuinely attempting to be humorous. Despite acknowledging the strong performances of the cast, particularly Ruth Gordon, the reviewer believes that the script ultimately undermines their efforts.

The reviewer's tone is one of outrage and frustration, with phrases like ""I was disgusted and didn't laugh once"" and ""A real lousy, sick film. Bottom of the barrel."" The mention of the original, even more disturbing ending that was thankfully changed only adds to the reviewer's overall disdain for the film.

The reviewer's criticism is not limited to the film's humor, as they also imply that it's not worth watching, advising readers to have a backup rental in case the evening is wasted on this film.

The reviewer's negative opinion is further emphasized by their comparison to Buster Keaton's classic comedies, which they hold in high esteem.

6354,"Not being a particular fan of westerns, I watched this primarily because I wanted to see Lucille Ball in something other than an ""I Love Lucy"" or ""Lucy Show"" type of role. Here she plays Christine Larson, owner of a saloon in the Arizona Territory in 1868 who's about to be married to the unscrupulous local Indian agent (Dean Jagger.) Ball's performance was OK - nothing really more than that; she didn't blow me away. It succeeded for me in that the role was very different from what I'm accustomed to seeing her in - there was very little of the outrageous physical comedy she later became famous for, although the movie tried to maintain a gently amusing feel throughout. (A typical funny line - ""there's two ways to deal with women - and no one knows either one of them!"") I didn't find the story all that compelling, although I appreciated that the Indians were shown as the victims of the Indian agent. There's typical shootout action and a lot of horses - your typical western in other words. As to Christine - we pretty much can guess from the beginning how her planned marriage is going to end up; it's just a question of how she's going to get there. If you like westerns, this would be a pretty typical one with a bit of humour thrown in. If you're not big on the genre, this will be lacking. I'm not big on the genre. 3/10",Negative,Negative,Negative,negative,"This review is mixed, but ultimately leans towards a negative perspective. The reviewer's primary motivation for watching the film was to see Lucille Ball in a different role, and while they acknowledge that she plays a character distinct from her typical comedic persona, they don't find her performance exceptional. The reviewer praises the film's attempt to portray Native Americans as victims of the Indian agent, but finds the story unengaging and predictable. The western genre itself seems to be the main issue, as the reviewer explicitly states that if you're not a fan of westerns, this film will be lacking.

The tone of the review is somewhat detached, with the reviewer providing a neutral, observational account of the film's elements without expressing strong emotions or enthusiasm. The reviewer's rating of 3/10 further reinforces the negative leaning of the review.

This departure from the source material is seen as a major flaw, making the story unengaging and the action scenes unimpressive. The reviewer also laments the lack of representation of other characters from the game, focusing too much on Ryu and neglecting the unique skills and personalities of other beloved characters.

The reviewer unfavorably compares this anime to the 1994 animated movie, which they consider superior. The tone of the review is critical, with the reviewer questioning the creative decisions behind the film, such as toning down the action and emphasizing supernatural elements over the characters' skills. The reviewer's overall assessment is that the anime fails to capture the essence of the video game, leading to a dull and unengaging viewing experience.

6357,"Spoilers abound. You have been warned.<br /><br />I was thoroughly disappointed, this being my first STREET FIGHTER movie I have seen (I dare not go near the 1994 joke yet). Very little grabs your attention in STREET FIGHTER ZERO (ALPHA) as opposed to most japanimation. The fights are hilariously done over board (Shun versus Zangief was a laugher) and the dramatization is far too moody especially toward the end when Ryu has to control everything in his fight against his brother.<br /><br />The main street fighter, Ryu, has been weakening to a far darker version inside of himself. Frustrations in controlling this darkness are further complicated by the sudden arrival of a younger brother! A shady street fighting tournament is held with more than just fighting on the promoter 's mind.<br /><br />What is with the artist 's drawing of feet? Any anime drawn above the stomach is impressive. The story 's soft nature makes the STREET FIGHTER genre far too intelligent, and places far more emphasis on a character (Shun), that is not even a fighter in the video game! A character study on more than just the core stars of the original STREET FIGHTER is completely ignored. How many times did you catch Rolento? Adon? Guy? STREET FIGHTER ZERO lacks the imagination of the video game.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, expressing disappointment and frustration with the STREET FIGHTER ZERO (ALPHA) movie. The reviewer criticizes the film's fight scenes, calling them ""hilariously done overboard"" and implying that they are excessive and unrealistic. The dramatization is also panned for being ""far too moody,"" particularly towards the end of the film. The reviewer seems to be disappointed that the movie focuses too much on Ryu's internal struggle and his relationship with his brother, rather than exploring the larger world of Street Fighter.

The reviewer also expresses frustration with the anime's artwork, specifically the drawing of feet, and feels that the story is too soft and lacks the imagination of the video game. The reviewer is also disappointed that the movie focuses on a character named Shun, who is not a fighter in the video game, rather than exploring the core stars of the original Street Fighter. The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and critical, implying that the movie fails to live up to the expectations of a Street Fighter adaptation.

6358,"This movie easily falls into the category of laughable, if not beyond that to actually insulting. I mean in what alternate universe did the filmmakers and studios think that this film would play? From beginning to end we bombarded with Quaids overacting and ridiculous facial expressions, laying on the ""im a loose cannon"" act a little thick. Another picking point I had with the movie was the lack of a realistic story of events that would make you grow to connect to a character. I mean in one scene where Lewis is playing in a bar before making it big there is this over the top, just completely absurd bar fight that every citizen in town is apparently a part of. Then Lewis begins to play his rendition of ""A whole lot of shaking'"" and everyone immediately forgets their differences and begins dancing wildly as if its the most normal thing in the world. These kind of scenes, of which there are numerous, coupled with the lack of depth in any of the characters led me to actual laughter.

The reviewer also criticizes the film's unrealistic storyline, citing an absurd bar fight scene where everyone suddenly forgets their differences and starts dancing wildly. The reviewer finds these scenes ridiculous and laughable, implying that the film is so bad it's good, but only in a mocking sense.

The reviewer's criticism extends to the lack of character development, stating that the film fails to create connections with the characters. The reviewer's overall assessment is that the film is not worth watching, unless one wants to mock the filmmakers and actors for an hour and a half.

6359,"This movie has some of the worst acting I've ever seen. Dennis Quaid's performance was high school caliber. While it's difficult to portray an off-the-wall character like Jerry Lee Lewis, it can be done. Just ask Jamie Foxx (although Ray Charles had more depth to his personality and musicianship than Lewis ever dreamed of possessing). The Phillips brothers portrayal belonged in The Dukes of Hazzard, and Alec Baldwin playing Jimmy Swaggart is a bit like Donald Duck performing Shakespeare. When Robert Duvall played a country preacher, I bought it. Baldwin never made me believe a single word. Wynona Ryder's part was the best, and she was mediocre. (And can anyone figure out how she was 13 when Lewis met her and still 13 more than a year later?)

The reviewer also criticizes the Phillips brothers' acting, comparing it unfavorably to The Dukes of Hazzard, and Alec Baldwin's portrayal of Jimmy Swaggart, stating that he failed to convince. The only slightly positive comment is made about Winona Ryder's performance, but even that is described as mediocre. The reviewer also questions the film's accuracy, pointing out inconsistencies in the timeline of the story.

The reviewer's tone is scathing, with a clear sense of disappointment and frustration. The comparison to Jamie Foxx's performance in Ray, a highly acclaimed biographical drama, serves to further emphasize the reviewer's dissatisfaction with the film.

6360,"It's really just terrible. Quaid overacts more than Shatner. The part where Elvis walks in and says ""You can have it all"" just kills anything that might have been good in this movie that's bad enough as it is. Drug use was completely snow coated, the only thing that had anything to do with his life was the bit about him wedding his cousin. Quaid also looks nothing like Lewis and has dark roots and eyebrows. I wish this could be re-made in the future with someone who doesn't try so hard. A bigger budget wouldn't hurt and maybe more about his actual life. I was very, very disappointed in Quaid.

The reviewer criticizes Dennis Quaid's performance, stating that he overacts and fails to convincingly portray Jerry Lee Lewis. The inclusion of Elvis Presley in the film is seen as a low point, and the reviewer feels that the movie glosses over Lewis's drug use and fails to accurately depict his life. The reviewer also takes issue with Quaid's physical appearance, noting that he doesn't resemble Lewis and has noticeable dark roots and eyebrows.

The reviewer's tone is scathing, with phrases like ""It's really just terrible"" and ""I was very, very disappointed"" conveying a strong sense of disillusionment. The reviewer even warns others not to watch the movie, implying that it's a waste of time. The only positive comment made is a brief mention of a scene depicting Lewis's marriage to his cousin, but this is vastly outweighed by the reviewer's numerous criticisms.

6361,"I haven't seen this film in years, but the awful ""taste"" of Quaid's performance still lingers on my tongue. Some have commented on how Quaid has Jerry Lee Lewis ""to a tee"" but the fact is he only appears to have the most extreme stage Jerry in mind. Nobody acts that way all the time, and the performance comes off as hopelessly clownish, reducing Lewis to a buffoonish caricature. The nuances of a man's life are lost in the rubble of sheer over-acting.<br /><br />The author of the book this is based on (Nick Tosches) is a good writer, who has written several fine musical bios (I particularly liked ""Dino"" on Dean Martin); in the books Tosches gives us a full human being, both separate from and involved in the ""biz."" Quaid's acting seems to imply that Jerry never acted like a human being. If people were like this, no one would bother to hang around them.

6362,"Just re-saw this last night and to put it bluntly: ""Style instead of substance"". We can already guess that there had to be a lot more to Jerry Lee Lewis than what is depicted here. The Jerry Lee Lewis character in this movie is not depicted as a real human being for one minute throughout the entire hour and a half plus running time, but then again, all the other characters are only one pencil-stroke from being total cartoon characters.<br /><br />Let's take the beginning. We see Jerry Lee and his cousin, Jimmy Swaggart sneaking over to the black jazz club and we see Jerry getting his inspiration. Might be possible. We see how the two cousins choose different paths in life (also possible). Then we cut to Jerry Lee playing the piano as an adult (now played by Dennis Quaid) and it's thrilling and a little scary. Cut to a scene where he first meets his second cousin, Myra. From then on the whole thing turns into a recap of certain events played out in a style befitting a news reel on high speed.<br /><br />Not that the movie is not a little entertaining and it's great to hear new versions of the songs that made Jerry Lee. Alec Baldwin as Jimmy Swaggart is also a reason why you should at least take a look at this, an indicator of his greater successes in the years to come. Winona Ryder as Myra is the most one noty character in the film. She teases, she sobs, she chews gum and play coquettish and that's about it. There is never for a minute given a reason why she ended up being the third Mrs. Lewis and speaking of wives, where are the first two? That is why this really can't be classified as a biopic, but more of a inaccurate news reel. We see Jerry get his first song played on the radio, we see his second single going into the top ten, we see his third go to no. 1 and so on. Then comes the inevitable downfall. Absolutely, no basis in reality.<br /><br />To conclude another minor quarrel: The movie takes place from '56 to '58 and still Myra says: ""I am only 13"" right up till the end.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is largely negative, criticizing the film for prioritizing style over substance and failing to provide a genuine portrayal of Jerry Lee Lewis's life. The reviewer argues that the film's characters, including Jerry Lee Lewis, are not depicted as real human beings, but rather as cartoonish figures. The narrative is described as a rushed, superficial recap of events, lacking depth and authenticity. The reviewer also expresses disappointment with the film's handling of Jerry Lee Lewis's relationships, particularly his marriage to Myra, which is portrayed as shallow and lacking in motivation.

The reviewer does acknowledge some positive aspects, such as the entertaining performances of the songs and Alec Baldwin's portrayal of Jimmy Swaggart. However, these positives are overshadowed by the reviewer's overall dissatisfaction with the film's lack of substance and accuracy.

6363,"I must say I was surprised to find several positive comments to this turkey (in desperate need of a feather transplant)! I'm giving it a 1 because I think the idea of making a movie about the wild man of rock'n'roll - Jerry Lee Lewis, is honorable, but it's a shame to put out such trash and the ""killer"" does not deserve this! It's a good thing it came late in his career... they said Elvis practically ruined his career with the movies he put out through the sixties and this could have done the same for Jerry lee, had it come out some 15-20 years earlier! It's based on Myra Gail Lewis book and that's a shame to begin with. It's a bad and inaccurate story of her life together with Lewis and there is far better books about the Killer, that could have made a much better and more interesting script. Add to this a bunch of actors who doesn't know if they are participating in a drama, comedy or a little bit of both! The otherwise fine actor Dennis Quaid is putting on what must be one of the worst performances of an actor in many a moon! He is walking around in the picture, talking about his ""god-given talent"" and as a spectator, you wish he'd show some of it on the screen too! Silly gestures and funny faces and Jerry Lee must have felt betrayed when he saw what had become of him in this truly awful movie! The rest of the crew is almost as bad... save for Winona Ryder, who does her best with the crappy lines given to her. It's ""Grease"" all over again and whenever Jerry Lee take a ride around Memphis in his convertible, having the radio on in the car, the whole town is dancing to the music from it! Everybody in this movie are like cartoon figures of the real people involved... from the wild man himself to Sun Records Sam Philips! And it's a damn shame!

The reviewer starts by expressing surprise that others have given positive comments about the film, implying that they are mistaken or misguided. The reviewer then proceeds to criticize the film's inaccurate portrayal of Jerry Lee Lewis's life, based on a flawed book by Myra Gail Lewis. The reviewer also targets the acting performances, particularly Dennis Quaid's portrayal of Jerry Lee Lewis, which they deem one of the worst performances in a long time. The reviewer mocks Quaid's gestures and facial expressions, implying that he failed to capture the essence of the rock 'n' roll legend.

The reviewer also criticizes the rest of the cast, except for Winona Ryder, who they acknowledge did her best with the poor script. The reviewer ridicules the film's cartoonish portrayal of real people, including Jerry Lee Lewis and Sam Philips, and expresses outrage that a charismatic artist like Jerry Lee Lewis was not given a better representation. The reviewer concludes by hoping that Jerry Lee Lewis took the money and told the filmmakers to leave him alone.

6364,"Dennis Quaid is tryin' hard to prove us that Jerry Lee Lewis was a dumb guy. And he's doing too much to prove it. TV sequences are very good, like a photocopy of old black and white footages.

I think the only good thing in this movie is to see young Winona Ryder.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is largely negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with the film's portrayal of Jerry Lee Lewis. The reviewer believes that Dennis Quaid's performance is over-the-top and tries too hard to convey Lewis as unintelligent, which comes across as forced and unconvincing. The reviewer does acknowledge some positive aspects, such as the TV sequences, which are reminiscent of old black and white footage, and the music, which features Jerry Lee Lewis' own singing. However, these positives are overshadowed by the reviewer's overall dissatisfaction with the film's Hollywood-style approach, which they liken to a ""Happy Days"" complex, implying a sanitized and overly nostalgic portrayal of the 1950s.

The only other redeeming quality mentioned is the presence of a young Winona Ryder, but even this is not enough to redeem the film as a whole. The reviewer's tone is critical and dismissive, implying that the film is a mediocre, B-movie-style production.

6365,"Great Balls of Fire is the movie you show to someone you really, really hate. It is absolute torture of the highest rank and is probably used by minions of a foreign power to extract info from captured intelligence agents. I've enjoyed some of Dennis Quaid's performances in the past, but he goes totally over the top in this film. He doesn't so much cross the line, he pole vaults over it, then comes back to jump over and over again. He struts and mugs as if on some incredibly bad acid trip. It's one of those rare performances where you wish you could enter the film and beat the man within an inch of his life for doing something so truly awful. Was he desperate to win a Golden Raspberry or some other award for bad acting? That's the only conclusion I can come up with. Thank you Dennis, you gave us a bad performance for the ages. Where was the director to reign in this guy?<br /><br />The opposite end of the extreme is Winona Ryder, she of the plastic features and plastic acting. I came across a review of her acting style that compared her to a wax dummy. That was of course an insult to wax dummies all over the earth, all of whom could have brough more humanity to the role of Jerry's underage cousin/wife. This brings up the film's mixed up message, that being it is 100% okay to marry your own cousin and have a child by the union. I fail to see what is so ""okay"" about that, but it looks as though Hollywood thinks that underage incest is hunky dory. Talk about ""family values.""<br /><br />Another problem is the format. Is it a stright forward re telling of Lewis' life, or is it a musical? I'm not talking about the music, I'm talking about the truly weird scene where Jerry drives up to the school, starts to belt out a tune and everyone starts to dance like it was Broadway musical in search of a Tony. Fantasy and reality are thrown together in a mix that does not work. But who really cares? I don't. And neither should you. You can't get back the minutes of life you would waste on this film. So don't waste your time, it's too precious for something this misguided and poor.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is an unrelenting and scathing critique of the film ""Great Balls of Fire"". The reviewer's tone is one of utter disdain, with the film being described as ""absolute torture"" and a performance by Dennis Quaid that is ""truly awful"". The reviewer's language is hyperbolic, with Quaid's acting being likened to a ""bad acid trip"" and the reviewer fantasizing about physically harming the actor for his performance. Winona Ryder fares no better, with her acting style being compared unfavorably to a wax dummy. The reviewer also takes issue with the film's message, which they perceive as promoting underage incest, and criticizes the film's format, which they see as a confusing mix of biographical drama and musical.

The reviewer's overall assessment is that the film is a complete waste of time, and that viewers would be better off avoiding it altogether. The tone is one of outrage and disgust, with the reviewer seemingly taking great pleasure in ripping the film apart. There is no attempt to balance criticism with praise or to offer constructive feedback; the review is a relentless attack on the film's every aspect.

The reviewer praises the film's ability to blend comedy and drama, creating a unique and captivating experience. The use of phrases like ""romp across a disbelieving outback"" and ""clashing confrontation of cultural assumptions"" suggests that the film's bold and unapologetic approach is a major part of its appeal. The reviewer also expresses a desire to have watched the film in a cinema audience in the outback, implying that the film's setting and themes would resonate strongly with that audience.

The tone of the review is playful and enthusiastic, with the reviewer seemingly delighted by the film's audacity and willingness to push boundaries. The only potential criticism mentioned is that the film might be ""a little too Queenie for some"", but this is presented as a minor quibble rather than a major issue. Overall, the review suggests that the film is a wildly entertaining and unforgettable ride.

6367,"I like all of the main actors involved in this quite bizarre film. Terrance Stamp, Guy Pearce & Hugo Weaving have all proved themselves as some of the best & most capable actors around, but I could not get into this. I don't know if it's because I don't understand the lifestyle or what, but I could not get my head around this film. Worse than anything is that the actors made some of the ugliest drag queens I've ever seen. I think that was part of the point, I don't know. I realize that is probably an insult, but I don't know what else to call them. I must say I bought the guys as the performers (the correct term?) but the story just wasn't very good or very interesting either. I will say that I can't usually appreciate costume designers very well, although I notice them when they are wrong or out of place, but I was very much impressed with these. Very creative to say the least, just not attractive, but I don't think they're supposed to be. I don't know I am definitely not the target audience and would never go see a performance done by these kind of performers, but I wouldn't go see ballet, or opera either so I don't know. If this is your kind of film then you will probably like it, but if it's not skip it because it is...well not for most of us.

Despite admiring the acting talents of the main cast, including Terence Stamp, Guy Pearce, and Hugo Weaving, the reviewer struggled to engage with the film's narrative.

The drag queens' appearances are described as ""ugly,"" which might be intentional, but this aspect of the film did not resonate with the reviewer. The costume design, however, is praised as ""very creative"" and deserving of its Oscar win.

The reviewer's tone is somewhat apologetic, acknowledging that they might not be the target audience for this film. The review concludes by suggesting that fans of this genre might enjoy the film, but others should avoid it. The comparison to Ebert's review, which was also negative, reinforces the reviewer's negative assessment.

6368,"Shaggy, friendly yet frustrating film has the same old message: if you want to make it in this world, being imaginative isn't enough, you have to live up to your place in society and that means living by the (heterosexual) rules that govern us. Drag queen comedy-drama from Australia is a mostly upbeat journey of three male friends traveling across the Outback in their pink bus, christened Priscilla. While not a formula film per se, there are the obligatory ""road movie"" sequences (bonding by the bonfire, facing down the rednecks, etc.). Writer-director Stephan Elliott follows every potentially mean-spirited moment with a little humor and sympathy, but there are puzzling gaps in his narrative, a dire subplot about a gay man's relationship with his ex-wife and estranged pre-teen son (both of whom are comfortable--and the child wise--with his lifestyle), and a third act with no energy whatsoever. It has some wicked transvestite humor and a fairly game cast, but a script that seems to have been watered down along the way. ** from ***",Negative,Negative,Negative,negative,"This review of ""The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"" is mixed, but ultimately leans towards a negative assessment. The reviewer praises the film's upbeat tone, humor, and sympathetic approach to its characters, particularly in its portrayal of drag queens. The cast is also commended for their performances. However, the reviewer expresses frustration with the film's narrative, citing ""puzzling gaps"" and a lack of energy in the third act. The subplot involving a gay man's relationship with his ex-wife and son is seen as underdeveloped, and the script is criticized for being ""watered down.""

The reviewer also expresses disappointment that the film ultimately reinforces traditional societal norms, suggesting that being imaginative and true to oneself is not enough to succeed in the world. This critique implies that the film's message is somewhat conservative and unoriginal. While the reviewer acknowledges some positive aspects of the film, the criticisms and frustrations expressed throughout the review outweigh the praise.

Answer: Negative"
6369,"""Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"" is always being trotted out as a masterpiece of Australian cinema. I found it quite disappointing. The lead actors are great - Terence Stamp is aging beautifully, Guy Pearce should do more comedy instead of the dour roles he chooses and I've been a fan of Hugo Weaving since I saw him play Oberon eons ago. The cinematography is great, but if you've ever been to the Australian outback, you'd know that the air is so clear and the light so brilliant that they could have shot it on the movie equivalent of a Box Brownie and it still would have looked spectacular.<br /><br />So what's my problem? Well, three things. First, there is not a sympathetic female character in the whole film. A woman who has to earn her living shooting ping pong balls out of her privates in a roadside pub deserves our sympathy. Tick's wife doesn't get much better treatment.<br /><br />Second, the scene when they sing ""I Will Survive"" to a group of Aboriginals is offensive. To try to draw any sort of parallel between the struggles of drag queens and trannies and the almost total destruction of Aboriginal culture, which is what I assume the scene is supposed to do, shows a level of historical understanding worthy of Paris Hilton.<br /><br />Last of all, and the greatest defect of the film is that it just isn't funny enough. Did Stephan Elliott actually talk to any drag queens when writing the film? Anyone who knows a drag queen (or three or four) knows that most of them have rapier-like wits and they're not afraid to use them. Now, I can understand that a lot of drag queen banter probably would have got the film refused classification but Elliott should have been able to gather enough ""fit for the kiddies"" material to complete his film.<br /><br />So, all in all, a waste of a good idea and a great cast.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review of ""Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"" is largely negative, despite acknowledging some positive aspects of the film. The reviewer praises the lead actors, particularly Terence Stamp, Guy Pearce, and Hugo Weaving, as well as the cinematography, which captures the beauty of the Australian outback. However, the reviewer's criticisms of the film far outweigh their praise.

The reviewer's main issues with the film are threefold. Firstly, they argue that the film lacks sympathetic female characters, instead portraying women in a derogatory manner. Secondly, they find the scene where the characters sing ""I Will Survive"" to a group of Aboriginals to be offensive and culturally insensitive. Lastly, they believe the film is not funny enough, suggesting that the writer did not adequately capture the wit and humor of drag queens.

The reviewer's tone is critical and disappointed, implying that the film wasted its potential with a great cast and idea. The reviewer's use of sarcastic language, such as comparing the writer's historical understanding to that of Paris Hilton, further emphasizes their negative opinion of the film.

6370,"This is one of those inoffensive and mildly entertaining little movies that strive to make you to like them more. But like so many others, it's material isn't strong enough to successfully fill a couple of hours.<br /><br />The pitch is promising: three drag queens drive a bus through the Outback from Sydney to Alice Springs. They run into lots of trouble - with homophobic locals, with the engine, with their pasts.<br /><br />The real trouble is with the dialogue. The leads are fine (though Pearce's continual campness becomes tiresome), but the one-liners and epithets feel forced where they should be casually thrown away. Characters shouldn't laugh at their own gags.<br /><br />Writer/director Elliott also feels the need to pile on the pleasingly incongruous shots of flamboyant drag costumes against stark desert backgrounds like so much cheap make-up.

The reviewer's main criticisms are directed towards the dialogue, which they find forced and unnatural, with characters laughing at their own jokes. This suggests that the script is not strong enough to support the film's ambitions. Additionally, the reviewer criticizes the director's approach, suggesting that the film's attempts to be visually striking, such as the juxtaposition of flamboyant costumes against desert backgrounds, come across as insecure and attention-seeking.

The reviewer's tone is somewhat dismissive, implying that the film is trying too hard to be liked, but ultimately falls short due to its weaknesses in script and direction. While the leads are described as ""fine,"" the reviewer's criticism of Hugo Weaving's performance as ""continually camp"" suggests that even the actors are not able to elevate the material. Overall, the review suggests that the film's flaws outweigh its mild entertainment value.

6373,"Terence Stamp can carry off anything, but this is still a shallow one-dimensional movie. It's nice to look at - so are the actors - and if you're into drag queens, I guess you might like it a lot, but the plot and characters are as thin as cardboard. It's one of those politically correct movies that warps everything else in order to make a 'minority lifestyle' seem warm and cuddly. It gets a lot of mileage out of bitchy dialogue, which is amusing in this sanitized form, I guess. <br /><br />Ninety percent of the action is parading around in gaudy costumes in incongruous situations.

6374,"Basically a road movie. The gay, transsexual, and other gender-bender themes are rather disturbing, particularly when the child is involved. You do have to hand it to the costume designers. As for the actors, the only one I was familiar with was Terence Stamp. I suppose it was a very good performance, out of his (or anyone's) normal range.

6379,"Distasteful British film from a Japanese novel about a very troubled young man who comes under the influence of a Hitler-like classmate and plots to harm his widowed mother's lover. A couple of good scenes (Sarah Miles discovering her son has been peeping at her and confronts him in anger, the pasty-faced lad trying to ensnare Kris Kristofferson to his demise by being extra friendly), but what's the point beyond provoking shock? Ugly and uneasy, it doesn't showcase anyone involved to any advantage (especially Kristofferson, whose hollow stares and usual gravelly talk is out-of-place in a psychological mishmash like this one).

If he's right, that's far more shocking than anything in ""Sailor"". * from ****",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is largely negative, criticizing the film ""Sailor"" for its distasteful and provocative content. The reviewer finds the storyline, based on a Japanese novel, to be unsettling and pointless, with the sole intention of shocking the audience.

Although the reviewer acknowledges a couple of memorable scenes, they are not enough to redeem the film's overall lack of purpose or redeeming qualities. The director, Lewis John Carlino, is criticized for taking the film's absurd premise too seriously, without acknowledging its inherent ridiculousness. The reviewer's tone is one of disappointment and frustration, implying that the film's attempts to provoke shock value come at the expense of meaningful storytelling or character development.

It simply doesn't make the transition into a credible story about Brits and Americans.<br /><br />The story moves sluggishly, especially the part where Miles and Kristofferson are separated and the director fills in with the cliched shots of a ship's prow cutting through the waves, and the little route line filling in on the maps, while their letters are heard in overvoice. The film moves so languidly that I even fast-forwarded through the sex and masturbation scenes which, although long, are not really either passionate or erotic. The film did achieve a measure of notoriety when Kristofferson's then-wife divorced him for extra-curricular activities with Miss Miles during the filming. I guess they enjoyed the sex scenes, but it isn't quite the same for a viewer.<br /><br />There are no characters to hang on to.

6392,"H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds by director David Michael Latt is a slightly less-than-average flick which isn't too bad if one considers the budget he had to work with - only $1 million. For this budget, the production value wasn't too bad - the best part of it is the visual effects (I was thoroughly impressed with the CGI considering the budget) and sound design. The less-then-stellar parts of this film are the story which is VERY prolonged at best (but again I think this is because of the budget they had - they had to prolong certain scenes to create the feature length 97 minutes), the acting (again it's because the actors had no story to work with), very few exceptional camera shots, and the music. However, again, I can let the negative parts go for the most part only because this film was made for a meager budget and still had good production value. Still you should,d see it for the sake of seeing how a low budget version of War of the Worlds CAN be made even with flaws. 4 out of 10.",Negative,Positive,"Mixed, but I'll classify it as... positive.",positive,"This review is a mixed assessment of the film ""H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds"" directed by David Michael Latt. The reviewer acknowledges that the film's production value is commendable, particularly the visual effects and sound design, considering the extremely low budget of $1 million. However, the reviewer criticizes the story, calling it ""VERY prolonged,"" and the acting, stating that the actors had little to work with in terms of the script. The camera work and music are also seen as subpar. Despite these criticisms, the reviewer is willing to overlook these flaws due to the film's low budget and the fact that it still manages to deliver some impressive production values.

The reviewer's tone is somewhat sympathetic, acknowledging the challenges of working with a limited budget. The rating of 4 out of 10 suggests that the reviewer does not think the film is exceptional, but it is still worth watching as an example of how to make a low-budget adaptation of a classic work like ""War of the Worlds.""

6393,"I am not a big fan of the Spielberg/Cruise version of this film. And so I must throw in with the more humble Latt/Howel version. C Thomas Howel had more heart and more sympathy that Cruise in the lead role (at least in my opinion). Now this is hard to imagine until you strip away everything thing in the Spielberg version that cost more than a thousand dollars. There would be nothing left, no special effects, no sets, no Cruise. Because I doubt that anything cost more than a cool grand in the David Michael Latt version. So, comparing apples to turnips I guess I have to go with the turnips. At least it gives independent movies a shot at the epic science fiction disaster market.",Negative,Negative,positive,positive,"This review is a comparative analysis of two film adaptations of the same story, with the reviewer expressing a clear preference for the lower-budget, independent version directed by David Michael Latt and starring C. Thomas Howell. The reviewer's criticism of the Spielberg/Cruise version is implicit, implying that it relied too heavily on expensive special effects, sets, and a high-profile star. In contrast, the Latt/Howell version is praised for its humility and the lead actor's ability to convey heart and sympathy in the role.

The reviewer's tone is tongue-in-cheek, using humor to make a point about the value of independent filmmaking. By stripping away the expensive elements of the Spielberg version, the reviewer argues that the Latt version is a more authentic, grassroots alternative. The use of the phrase ""apples to turnips"" acknowledges the unfairness of comparing two vastly different productions, but the reviewer is willing to give the underdog a chance.

Overall, the review is positive towards the Latt/Howell version, celebrating its DIY spirit and the opportunities it provides for independent filmmakers to tackle ambitious projects.

6394,"I wish I could have given this a Zero. Sure I'll admit that I also mistakenly picked this up thinking it was the Spielberg version. A clever marketing ploy releasing it at this time and being prominently displayed at the video store. However, I was willing to give it a go anyhow - I wish I wouldn't have.<br /><br />Where do I start? I have read some of the other reviews here and have to say I disagree with anyone who thinks any of the acting was good - sorry even C. Thomas Howell stunk. None of the performances were any good. Not a one.<br /><br />Even if the acting was decent the dialog is terrible! ""Ginormus"" and ""dick skinners"" just doesn't really cut it.<br /><br />Now as for the story well - it was terribly adapted and must have been edited by a 5 year old. The main character is constantly running into situations that are way convenient - or at least appear that way due to how the film was edited together. For example he is trying to get to a place called New Hope to find his brother. During a brief break someone just randomly hands him the directions to New Hope. What the hell is that? When he gets to New Hope he just happens to stumble onto his dying brother. Then there is the part where he has been traveling away from his destination for days and just happens to come across the car his wife and son were traveling in. He was going in a different direction then they were how did that car end up where he was? He has a black back pack that randomly appears and disappears throughout the film. There are parts of the film where the characters are just waking up in the morning and then two seconds later it is night - or worse yet dusk of the next day. I also can't forget the main character and the preacher falling through the floor of a house for no reason - we don't find out until later that an alien has landed on the house. Which reminds me of the moment when they are walking and suddenly find themselves standing under an alien they didn't notice. What the hell, the aliens are like two stories tall with huge bodies and multiple legs - how could they miss it? There is one point where an alien kills a random citizen, supposedly by spitting some kind of junk at him - but you never see the stuff fly it just appears on the guys face. The special effects in general are terrible. The entire movie is like a bad ""train wreck"". When we finally get to the end, after this guy trying to get to DC to find his family, they just appear. No searching no asking questions nothing. Just oh there you are I am so happy - the end.<br /><br />I am sorry if my review rambles a bit but this movie was so bad I had a hard organizing my contempt. Please save yourself the time and don't watch this sneakily displayed pile of cinematic stench. It is quite possibly the worst film I have ever witnessed. I would rather have been getting a root canal - It would have been less painful.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is an unrelenting and scathing critique of the film, with the reviewer expressing their utter disdain and disappointment.

The reviewer's criticism of the acting is particularly harsh, stating that not a single performance was good, including C. Thomas Howell's. They also ridicule the dialogue, citing examples of cringe-worthy lines like ""Ginormus"" and ""dick skinners."" The story is panned for its convenience, with the main character stumbling into situations that feel contrived and unrealistic. The editing is also criticized for its poor pacing, with scenes feeling disjointed and illogical.

The reviewer's frustration and anger are palpable throughout the review, with them describing the film as a ""bad 'train wreck'"" and a ""pile of cinematic stench."" They conclude by warning others to avoid the film at all costs, stating that it's possibly the worst film they've ever seen and that they would rather undergo a root canal than watch it again.

6395,"This movie looked like the out-takes of the deleted scenes from a high school film class experiment. It made no sense! It was well acted, but I only felt sorry for the characters because they had to appear in this slop. The alien machines were created with Pentium I technology and no creativity, they were crabs! The under-lit and barely seen aliens were Frisbees with legs. WHERE WERE THE TRIPODS? The editing, done by director/writer/producer/make-up artist/gripper Latt, jumps all over the place, with some scenes repeated numerous times. Most of it seemed to have been filmed in the wake of hurricane Katrina. The next time Latt wants to make a movie, someone needs to slap him. In 2005 alone he produced 11 movies! That doesn't include the writing, editing, directing or visual effects credits on other movies. If the rest are like this snot-load, then he's just making fun of us. This was a slapped together rip-off of Spielberg's movie, nothing more.

The reviewer also criticizes the editing, stating that it ""jumps all over the place"" and that some scenes are repeated multiple times. The tone of the review is sarcastic and mocking, with the reviewer implying that the director, Latt, is churning out low-quality films at an alarming rate (11 movies in 2005 alone). The reviewer accuses Latt of making fun of the audience and ripping off Spielberg's movie. The review ends with the reviewer sarcastically looking forward to Latt's future projects, implying that they will be just as bad.

6396,"After watching the Steven Spielberg version of War Of The Worlds in theaters, I was hooked on the topic. I could think back to my favorite parts in the movie, people getting vaporized, people panicking, fire, explosions, it was all so great...<br /><br />So a few weeks later I enter my video store, and I see David Michael Latt's version of War Of The Worlds on the shelf. ""It couldn't have come onto DVD, that fast, could it?"" I said to myself. I read the back of the case and saw C. Thomas Howell, instead. ""Oh, I remember him from The Outsiders!"" So I thought, it might have been a try.<br /><br />I was wrong, dead wrong. As soon as I watched the opening credits, watched them take forever, I knew something was wrong. Something was going to disappoint me in this film and it did. The whole movie stunk like a cheese sauce that was left in the fridge for 10 years. From the acting, the special effects (stupid looking tripod things, when people get vaporized they turn into orange skeletons), and most of all, it didn't even come close to being as interesting as the Spielberg version, in fact, the plot was boring, and there were only 3 scenes of destruction! What the crap? I ended up being so bored, that I had to fast forward through the movie until I found something that looked even remotely interesting. And nothing was really.<br /><br />My advice: Don't even touch this movie, stay 100 feet away from it. The Spielberg version is coming out near the end of this month, buy that one! But please, please, I beg of you! Stay away from this turd before it smothers us all!",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is extremely negative, with the reviewer expressing strong disappointment and frustration with David Michael Latt's version of War of the Worlds. The reviewer's initial enthusiasm for the topic, sparked by Steven Spielberg's version, quickly turns to disillusionment as they realize the low quality of Latt's film. The criticism is multifaceted, targeting the acting, special effects, and plot, which are all deemed subpar. The reviewer is particularly scathing about the special effects, describing the tripod creatures as ""stupid looking"" and the vaporization effects as unconvincing, with people turning into ""orange skeletons."" The plot is also panned for being boring, with too few scenes of destruction, leading to boredom and a need to fast-forward through the movie.

The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and humorous, with exaggerated language used to emphasize their dislike, such as comparing the movie to ""a cheese sauce that was left in the fridge for 10 years."" The advice to ""stay 100 feet away"" from the movie and the plea to ""please, please"" avoid it further underscore the reviewer's strong negative opinion.

The graphics are also panned, with the reviewer describing them as ""horrendous"" and ""less than fake.""

The reviewer also mocks the protagonist, portrayed by C. Thomas Howell, calling him a ""rambling through the countryside star gazer work-a-holic"" and implying that his character is lunatic. The reviewer also expresses frustration with the film's climax, where the protagonist survives despite the apocalyptic scenario, and the ending is described as ""sappy.""

The tone of the review is sarcastic and dismissive, with the reviewer seemingly taking pleasure in ridiculing the film. The final sentence, which suggests that C. Thomas Howell will regret starring in this film and that it will give him nightmares, is particularly scathing.

6398,"My paraphrase above of the slogan on the back of the DVD box sums it up: this film was far more horrible than horrifying.<br /><br />This is the worst film I have seen in as long as I can remember. My wife accidentally rented it thinking it was the Tom Cruise version. The laughably crude special effects on the menu screen should have tipped us off. The gratuitous nudity already in the opening scene made us more suspicious.<br /><br />But as the film wore on, we were benumbed by clumsy acting -- both over- and under-acting -- non-continuity in directing and editing, trite writing, and crude special effects. We gave up after a half-hour or less; after starting this badly, it couldn't possibly get better.<br /><br />Since I despise reviews that pan a product without giving specifics, here are some examples of the film's especially awkward moments, even if they amount to spoilers:<br /><br />- The lead says good-bye to his young old son as the latter is about to drive away with his mother, the latter prickly because it's their wedding anniversary but the lead is not coming along due to sudden business. The son asks, quietly worried, ""will I ever see you again?"" Perhaps it's supposed to come off as a premonition, but it instead comes off as incongruous behavior for a child that age in that situation.<br /><br />- A huge alien spacecraft has crashed to earth and sits in an enormous crater. A crowd of people stands nearby, peering at it uneasily but otherwise looking generally unaroused. One woman finally says ""it's gi-normous!""<br /><br />- After this craft has laid waste a village and its inhabitants, the lead and a bystander, now alone near their homes and trying to load their cars for an escape, have an exchange something like this, in a quietly puzzled tone:<br /><br />""What was that thing, anyway?"" ""I dunno...""<br /><br />- A crowd attempting to evacuate over a bridge is blocked by the military, since part of the bridge is destroyed. When an alien ship shoots an explosive at it, the crowd starts to run away, seemingly only because a director told them to and not because they're frightened or in any kind of real danger, let alone unusual circumstances.<br /><br />And so forth... writing about the film falls short of the experience of actually seeing it. But please, PLEASE, save yourself the bother, even if your morbid curiosity is piqued! The film is so bad it can't even be enjoyed as unintentional humor (versus, say, King Vidor's ""Solomon & Sheeba"" starring Yul Brynner wearing a wig).

6399,"It is hard to imagine anyone making a Tom Cruise film look good; hard indeed, but this one makes him look good. Very good. Actually, it makes him look like Sir John Gielgud celebrating Very Good Acting Day with a bravura performance.<br /><br />The acting from the entire ensemble struggled to rise above the risible and failed. The fault was, in part let us be fair, that the plot bore as much resemblance to the HG Wells original as did the butchered carcasses of the human victims in the film to their living predecessors: both were bloodied and violated remnants of more attractive predecessor. But to describe a plot such as this to be a bit holy is to say of the Colander ""My, this kitchen utensil has a remarkable lot of holes"", unless, that is, holes are your bag; in which case this film will commend itself to you.<br /><br />The fault in the other part was that these were demotivated, jobbing, DVD actors who knew full well, one assumes, that this was their exhibition that would wind up on the $5 DVD shelf.

6400,"Let's get one thing straight; This was BAD! So Putrid that it doesn't even qualify to be imprinted on anyone's memories.<br /><br />The ever repeating storyline (who's constant recycling of not only jokes but story lines and character appearances.) A typical storyline goes as follows; Sue (the mother) opens the episode quoting on how she loves her baby son but smells awful (As if THAT doesn't get old! har-de-bloody-har!), some Australian quasi-nationalist ""bogan"" -look it up- appears to say how she thinks she's awesome because she's an ozzie while everything/everyone else that isn't sucks before disappearing for the rest of the episode.

6401,"OK, first off there may be a SPOILER here since i don't know what constitutes giving out too much information. My subject line says it all but surely people will want to know WHY it's so stupid.<br /><br />First off, this film follows a bunch of Yuppies as they go to a sports game in Chicago but wind up taking the wrong exit and winding up in the ghetto. Scary, huh? Well, first of all, Emilio is driving everyone in the world's most overblown RV/Winnebago, tricked out with satellite dishes and crap like that on it. So these guys are GOING to a sports game (i forget which, though likely the Bulls or the White Sox since they're near the oh-so-scary ghetto), yet they can't even make it down the freeway without having an onboard viewing command center that would put ESPN to shame. Yet they're smart enough to earn livings that would pay for the stuff, but are such sports fans that they don't even know which exit to get off at on their way to the game they so love.<br /><br />I gave up on the movie within a half hour after that, but the reasons were plentiful. They wind up IN THE GHETTO, yet their main danger to their existence is DENIS LEARY. A WHITE GUY. I'm no racist, but COME ON. In anything RESEMBLING reality - and this film WAS trying to be an urban nightmare - Denis Leary would not be trying to kill Emilio Estevez, he'd be hitching a ride to get the f*** out of Dodge himself!!!<br /><br />This is easily one of the dumbest movies ever created, although I'm not familiar with much of the rest of the world's cinema. If MST3K were still on, they surely would have devoted an episode to this one.",Negative,negative,negative,negative,"This review is extremely negative, with the reviewer expressing frustration and disbelief at the film's plot and characters. The reviewer's main criticism is that the film's portrayal of a group of yuppies getting lost in the ghetto is unrealistic and absurd. They point out that the characters are supposedly sports fans, yet they can't even navigate their way to the game without getting lost, despite having a high-tech RV equipped with satellite dishes. The reviewer also ridicules the idea that Denis Leary, a white guy, would be the main threat to the characters' existence in the ghetto, suggesting that in reality, he would be more likely to be trying to escape the area himself.

The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and mocking, with phrases like ""Scary, huh?"" and ""COME ON"" emphasizing their incredulity at the film's plot. They also compare the film unfavorably to Mystery Science Theater 3000, a TV show known for mocking bad movies.

6402,"I really liked the idea of traveling between dimensions, and I even liked the Wade/Quinn tension in early episodes. Some of the worlds they created gave the main characters extremely interesting backdrops for their stories. However, as the show went on there were more silly disputes among the friends and less of a true bond. There was less wonder and excitement when they were involved in other worlds and more condescension. And every world had one of the characters falling in love. The writing just got boring and everything was way too over the top. Too bad it would've been nice to have a closely knit band of friends (a la Star Wars) traveling to different dimensions on TV for several years, rather than a tired band of knit pickers.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review expresses a mix of positive and negative sentiments towards the show, but ultimately leans towards a negative assessment. The reviewer initially appreciated the concept of interdimensional travel and the tension between Wade and Quinn in the early episodes. They also enjoyed the creative backdrops provided by the various worlds the characters visited. However, as the show progressed, the reviewer felt that the relationships between the friends deteriorated, becoming more petty and condescending. The writing became dull, and the show's reliance on romantic plotlines in every world grew tiresome.

The reviewer's disappointment is palpable, as they had envisioned a tight-knit group of friends exploring different dimensions, akin to the camaraderie found in Star Wars. Instead, the show devolved into petty squabbles and over-the-top storylines. The reviewer's tone is one of frustration and disillusionment, implying that the show failed to live up to its initial promise.

6403,"Loving the Andersen fairy tails as a child and recently having seen some intriguing documentaries on this odd, though brilliant, author, I eagerly looked forward to see this made-for-TV film. Unfortunately the experience was nothing but a disappointment leaving me in anger and confusion. First of all the story/script is filled with inaccuracies and downright fantasies and in this way creating almost a completely new story while shamefully abusing Andersen's fairy tales, presumably in order to sell the crap to suckers like me. Secondly, pretty-boy actor (really... ever seen a picture of the real Andersen?) Kieran Brew manages to portray Hans Christian as mentally retarded rather than the brilliant though very disturbed character he indeed was. Though annoying and irritating like Andersen, Brew is missing the required charisma to create any feelings of compassion what so ever. Thirdly. The love story between Andersen and the fictional Jetta (whom actually should be Henriette, the wife of Edvard Collin)... Why? This man has lived such an interesting life, it should be enough as a foundation to a great movie!<br /><br />I could continue this to be a very long list but feel it safest to simply recommend all of you to spend your time and money on something else instead.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, expressing disappointment, anger, and frustration with the made-for-TV film about Hans Christian Andersen. The reviewer, who was initially enthusiastic about the film due to their fondness for Andersen's fairy tales and interest in the author's life, was let down by the numerous inaccuracies and creative liberties taken with the story. They criticize the script for deviating significantly from the truth, seemingly to appeal to a wider audience.

The reviewer also expresses discontent with the casting of Kieran Brew as Andersen, feeling that he fails to capture the complexity and charisma of the real person. The addition of a fictional love story between Andersen and a character named Jetta is seen as unnecessary and inaccurate, as the real Andersen had a significant relationship with Henriette, the wife of Edvard Collin.

The reviewer's tone is one of exasperation, with a sense of betrayal and wasted time. They conclude by strongly advising others to avoid the film and spend their time and money on something else.

The reviewer's conclusion is unequivocal, stating that they ""can't believe"" they wasted their time on this film, implying a strong sense of regret and dissatisfaction. The only faint praise offered is a half-hearted suggestion that someone might enjoy the film if they're in the mood for a ""crazy dude running around,"" but even this is tempered by the implication that there are better options available.

6407,"There is nothing mean spirited or evil about this movie. It's just terribly dull. Dull is the photography--- the film stock appears old and faded and washed-out. Maybe it was even 16mm blown up to 35mm, dunno. Dull is the script, which is tedious and 'Jules Pfeiffer'-ish. That is, kind of 1960s bossa-nova cocktail party cool. Like our beatnik grandparents might have spoken if they were trying to appear really straight. The 'slice-of-life' characters were mostly annoying. True, they were real to life, but hey, if I wanted to see truly ordinary people doing really mundane and ordinary things, I'd just watch myself. I wouldn't trapse all the way down to a cinema and blow five quid, and an evening, watching someone else do it.<br /><br />I expected a funny, bright rom-com. What I got was more like what two intelligent and moderately talented 19 or 20 year-olds might have produced on their first day with a new video camera.<br /><br />I gave this a 4 out 10, because it appears that someone tried, at least.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and boredom with the film. The reviewer criticizes the film's technical aspects, describing the photography as ""dull"" and suggesting that it may have been shot on low-quality film stock. The script is also panned, with the reviewer finding it ""tedious"" and trying too hard to be cool and sophisticated. The characters are described as ""annoying"" and ""ordinary,"" with the reviewer implying that they would rather observe their own mundane life than watch the film.

The reviewer's tone is one of frustration and disappointment, as they had expected a lighthearted romantic comedy but instead found the film to be dull and amateurish. The comparison to a student film project implies that the reviewer believes the filmmakers lacked skill and experience. The only positive comment is a faint praise, acknowledging that ""someone tried, at least,"" which is not enough to redeem the film in the reviewer's eyes.

6408,"This film attempts to cash in on the success of Richard Curtis movies, particularly ""Love Actually"" (which I loved) - a series of disparate scenes following the love lives of various couples. <br /><br />It's a great idea poorly executed. The script tries to be a little too clever and simply doesn't resonate. Most of the acting is stilted which is more a reflection on the director than the actors.<br /><br />The version I saw (on a plane) was called ""Scenes from a Park"", which is a more appropriate title as not all the scenes were of a 'sexual nature'.<br /><br />I was so looking forward to this movie, but ultimately it is disappointing. Don't bother.",Negative,negative,negative,negative,"This review is decidedly negative, criticizing the film for its poor execution of a promising concept. The reviewer draws a comparison to Richard Curtis's ""Love Actually,"" implying that the film attempts to replicate the success of that movie but falls short. The script is deemed too clever, and the acting is described as stilted, with the blame placed on the director rather than the actors. The reviewer expresses disappointment, having looked forward to the film, and ultimately advises against watching it.

The tone of the review is dismissive, with the reviewer's criticism of the film's execution and acting. The use of phrases like ""great idea poorly executed"" and ""doesn't resonate"" emphasizes the reviewer's disappointment and frustration with the film. The suggestion that the title ""Scenes from a Park"" is more appropriate than the original title further underscores the reviewer's negative opinion.

6409,"the acting is good.thats the positives out of the way! SOSN is shallow and superficial.Almost all the characters are middle class and English.The gay men are depicted as fickle sexual predators aiming to use children in their empty lives.This film could only appeal to people who know hampstead heath and would get minor satisfaction from pointing out any landmarks.There is no time to engage with the characters and has a result you really don,t care about them,Catherine Tate at the height of her comedic fame stars as a woman seeking a divorce from her husband and on screen for about the same time as her Nana sketches failed to convince,however if she had said ""what a f****** liberty"" i would have agreed <br /><br />I'd rather take a walk in the Park;unintelligent rubbish!",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing strong dissatisfaction with the film ""SOSN"". The only positive comment made is a brief acknowledgment that the acting is good, but this is quickly overshadowed by a litany of criticisms. The reviewer argues that the film is shallow and superficial, with poorly developed characters that lack depth and relatability. The depiction of gay men is particularly problematic, with the reviewer accusing the film of portraying them as ""fickle sexual predators"" who prey on children. This criticism suggests that the film perpetuates harmful stereotypes and reinforces negative attitudes towards the LGBTQ+ community.

The reviewer also expresses frustration with the film's focus on middle-class English characters, implying that the film's narrow perspective limits its appeal and relevance. The mention of Hampstead Heath as a potential point of interest for some viewers is seen as a minor consolation, but ultimately, the reviewer argues that the film fails to engage the audience emotionally, making it difficult to care about the characters or their stories.

The tone of the review is scathing, with the reviewer using strong language to express their disdain for the film. The final sentence, ""I'd rather take a walk in the Park; unintelligent rubbish!"", drives home the reviewer's complete dismissal of the film's value.

6410,"This film is about the encounters of 7 couples on Hampstead heath in one sunny Wednesday afternoon.<br /><br />It shows 7 different types of couples: married, divorced, breaking up a relationship, homosexual, elderly, blind date and escort service. They are not connected to each other apart from the geographical location, so that is a disappointment. The film is a collage of conversations, without any discernible plot. The film jumps from a pair to another without any logic. I find this film boring and purposeless. The only redeeming feature is the great weather throughout the film. It is sad that talents like Ewan McGregor and Sophie Okonedo get wasted by this film.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is predominantly negative, expressing disappointment and boredom with the film's structure and content. The reviewer criticizes the film's lack of a cohesive narrative, instead presenting a disjointed series of conversations between seven different couples on Hampstead Heath. The reviewer finds the film's format, which jumps between the couples without any logical connection or plot, to be unengaging and pointless. The only positive aspect mentioned is the pleasant weather depicted in the film, which is hardly enough to redeem the overall experience.

The reviewer also expresses disappointment that talented actors like Ewan McGregor and Sophie Okonedo are underutilized in the film. The tone of the review is one of frustration and disillusionment, implying that the film fails to deliver any meaningful or engaging experience for the viewer.

6411,"If you never have read the book and never intend to read it in the future, go on and watch the movie (6/10). It is a nice fantasy movie with well done CGI, nice acting, a beautiful environment and an above-average fantasy story.<br /><br />If you have read the book like me about 10 times or more and really love it, don't expect too much (or better: don't expect anything at all). The story is totally different from the original book. This may explain that the movie is voted 1/10 from people around 40 or more (like me) and much better from people who most probably never read the book before and thus expect nothing.<br /><br />Most of the differences between movie and book are not really necessary and change the setting (in my opinion much to the worse): <br /><br />- The magic in the book works with rituals for classic magical effects. (Changing weather, creating illusions, transform into animals, ...) In the movie the magic is more like ""jedi-school for the middle ages"" (TM) (wooden sticks instead of lightsabers). That the devil is looking like emperor palpatine (after part III) doesn't make it really better.<br /><br />- The mill in the book is not totally cut off the world like in the movie. In the book the story is set near Dresden, which Krabat visits one time with his master and also he visits some nearby villages for festivities. (This part might have been changed to cut costs.) I also don't understand why in the movie the mill is located in the hills while the nearby graveyard is set in the high mountains.<br /><br />- The whole surrounding is the average run of the mill fantasy medieval style. Lots of mud everywhere, dirty faces, not an orderly kitchen, only very rough houses. The book never suggested such an environment.<br /><br />- In the book the master tries to make Krabat his successor but Krabat rejects. Krabat is somewhere between admiration, distance and silent rejection. In the movie Krabat rejects the master always openly like a stubborn schoolboy.<br /><br />- The movie is set in 1647 instead of around 1720. This makes it impossible for the master to tell some stories from his youth probably around 170x. OK, the stories are missing anyway in the movie.<br /><br />Also some explanations given in the book would have been helpful and would not cost so much minutes: <br /><br />- In the book all work done at day is effortless and work in the night is like normal work. This explanation is missing in the movie. Sometimes the boys are sweating and sometimes they are happy.<br /><br />- The book explains why only a few ""Gesellen"" try to confront the master: If the master dies by any mundane reasons, the ""Gesellen"" are free AND keep their magical powers. If the master dies at the confrontation, all will lose their power forever.",Negative,"Mixed, but overall: Negative",Negative,negative,"This review is a mixed assessment of the movie adaptation of a book, with the reviewer's opinion heavily influenced by their familiarity with the original novel. The reviewer advises that those who haven't read the book might enjoy the movie as a ""nice fantasy movie"" with impressive CGI, acting, and environment. However, for those who have read the book, especially multiple times, the movie is likely to be a disappointment due to significant deviations from the original story.

The reviewer lists several key differences between the book and the movie, including changes to the magic system, the setting, and character interactions. These changes are seen as unnecessary and detrimental to the story, altering the tone and atmosphere of the narrative. The reviewer also points out omissions of important explanations and backstory from the book, which would have enhanced the movie's coherence and depth.

The reviewer's tone is critical, with a sense of disappointment and frustration at the movie's failure to capture the essence of the book. The rating of 6/10 is a lukewarm assessment, implying that the movie has some redeeming qualities but ultimately falls short of expectations.

The only redeeming thing in this film is the occasional good action scene, although most come round because of insanely stupid reasons. The plot in this film is absolute gibberish.

6413,"Two L.A cops track down a serial killer nicknamed ""The family man"" who has wiped out whole families and when one of the police officer's wife takes the deep six, questions are raised and it turns out that a serial killer isn't responsible but rather mobsters. The idea of Seagal in a serial killer movie is an interesting concept, indeed one could see Seagal play a good serial killer however making him a cop who has a ridiculous penchant for prayer beads and razor sharp credit cards comes off more stupid than likably ridiculous. Also a running joke involves Wayon's enjoyment of eating powdered deer penis and well this raunchy material is utterly out of place. Not to mention the beginning of a school being taken hostage, due to a boy's breakup with his girlfriend. After Seagal neutralizes him, the girlfriend tells the young lad that she loves him. Now there is a lesson to be learned from all of this, if you want your girlfriend back, taking the school hostage may get you back on her good side.

The reviewer criticizes Steven Seagal's character, a cop with a penchant for prayer beads and razor-sharp credit cards, as coming across as stupid rather than likable. The reviewer also mocks the film's attempt at humor, specifically a running joke involving Wayans' character eating powdered deer penis, which is deemed out of place and raunchy. Furthermore, the reviewer ridicules the film's portrayal of a school hostage situation, which is resolved with the girlfriend telling the boy she loves him, implying that taking a school hostage is a viable way to win someone back.

The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and dismissive, with a hint of irony and humor. The use of phrases like ""utterly out of place"" and ""brilliant reconciliation plan"" is meant to be ironic and mocking. The reviewer's criticism is not limited to the film's plot and characters but also extends to its themes and messages, implying that the film promotes unhealthy and unrealistic solutions to relationship problems.

6414,"New Year 2006, and I'm watching Glimmer Man again. Say what you like, I find Steven Seagal's movies amusing. Like many comments, good fight sequences - I particularly liked his answering of the phone at the restaurant saying how long it would be closed for restoration. Bit like Schwarzenegger's humour in the earlier action films - although that tended to be self-deprecating.<br /><br />But the one I like here is Brian Cox. One of the most versatile actors around. Pity about his hand and foot, but so much for withstanding extended interrogation - must have flunked that class at the ""farm"".<br /><br />As the films went on I wonder just how the ever thickening girth of Seagal affected his movement?.

The tone of the review is lighthearted and playful, with the reviewer poking fun at Seagal's physical appearance, joking about how his increasing weight affected his movement in the film. However, this is done in a non-critical and affectionate manner, suggesting that the reviewer is a fan of Seagal's work.

6415,A not so good action thriller because it unsuccessfully trends the same water as early Steven Seagal films because there is not a very good set piece. Steven Seagal plays the same kind of character that he has played since Above the Law. In my opinion the performance of Keenen Ivory Wayans is wasted in such an average film and belongs in a much better film. Bob Gunton is okay as the main heavy. The best acting in the entire film belongs to Brian Cox who is very frightening in the role of the murderer. My favorite scenes are the fight scenes with the Russian mafia. One of the film reasons to see The Glimmer Man(1996) is for the brief appearence of the beautiful and voluptupus Nikki Cox. Its too bad that there were not more scenes with her in them.,Negative,Negative,Negative,negative,"This review is generally negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment with the film's inability to deliver a compelling action thriller experience.

The reviewer also believes that Keenen Ivory Wayans' talent is wasted in this average film, implying that he deserves better material.

However, the reviewer does find some redeeming qualities in the film. Brian Cox's performance as the murderer is praised as ""very frightening,"" and the fight scenes with the Russian mafia are enjoyable.

The reviewer questions how Seagal became a movie star, implying that it's a mystery. They also ridicule the script, calling out the unrealistic and unprofessional dialogue, particularly in a scene where Seagal's character, Jack Cole, tries to negotiate with a suicidal gunman.

The reviewer's criticism extends to the plot, which they describe as a plagiarized mess, borrowing from superior movies featuring serial killers. They also poke fun at the film's attempts to humanize Seagal's character by showcasing his domestic life, implying that it's a weak attempt to make the character more relatable.

6417,"Typical Steven Seagal fare: that is, it's crap.

The reviewer ridicules the plot, calling it reliant on ""incredibly improbable coincidences"" and conspiracy theories that are made worse by Seagal's apparent belief in them. The review also mocks Seagal's on-screen persona, pointing out that his character's survival is often due to the incompetence of the villains, who always seem to give him an opportunity to escape or defeat them.

The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and dismissive, with a focus on ridiculing the film's flaws rather than providing a balanced critique. The comparison to another Seagal film, ""Fire Down Below,"" implies that this film is not even the worst of Seagal's oeuvre. The only positive comment, if it can be called that, is a tongue-in-cheek appreciation for the ""Incredible Disappearing Forehead Wound"" in the final fight scene, which is presented as the most entertaining aspect of the film.

6418,"Kennan Ivory Wayans was so funny in Low Down Dirty Shame that I had to see this one and it was one of the worst he has done and Steven Seagal didn't help much.

He is surprised to see a new partner waiting for him to work by his side to crack the case but Jack Cole doesn't seem to be who everyone thinks he is until Jack's ex wife is killed in one of those ritual killings that end up making him the suspect as well. It's the same thing as all of his other movies: Smoke past, CIA involvement and now trying to be a normal cop. Why does Steven dress up like he is from a Western movie?

The reviewer starts by mentioning that they were drawn to the movie because of Keenan Ivory Wayans' performance in another film, but were let down by this particular effort. The plot is criticized for being convoluted and nonsensical, with the reviewer struggling to understand the motivations behind the ritual killings. The introduction of a new partner, Jack Cole, is seen as unconvincing, and the reviewer questions the character's true identity.

The reviewer also expresses frustration with Steven Seagal's character, criticizing his attire as reminiscent of a Western movie and the inclusion of prayer beads as confusing. The reviewer implies that the film relies on familiar tropes from Seagal's other movies, such as a troubled past, CIA involvement, and the protagonist's desire to be a normal cop. The tone of the review is one of disappointment and disillusionment, with the reviewer implying that the film is a rehashing of familiar ideas rather than a fresh or original take.

6419,"Maybe it was the excessive weight gain Seagal had put on. Or maybe it was the horrible acting of Wayans in an action flick. Or was it the total lack of chemistry between the two leading characters? These and other considerations lead me to conclude that Seagal should have never made this acting nightmare. True, the story line was good. Yet, as an avid follower of Seagal's career and background, his physical appearance was inconsistent with his genre of clean, pure, healthy Zen Buddhist living, notably in his on screen discussions with Wayans. (Then again his real life affair with the ""nanny"" was inconsistent also!)<br /><br />If Seagal wants to become a more diversified actor, then he should do what a fellow action figure did in ""Kindergarten Cop""...put humorous material or situations in the script where the actor has no choice but to react in a comical way.

The reviewer also criticizes the film's attempts at humor, suggesting that Seagal is not suited for comedic roles and that the humor falls flat.

The only positive comment made is a brief mention of the storyline being good, but this is quickly overshadowed by the reviewer's numerous criticisms. The reviewer's tone is disapproving and sarcastic, with a hint of disappointment and frustration. The comparison to ""Kindergarten Cop"" and the suggestion that Seagal should stick to his action hero persona further emphasizes the reviewer's negative opinion of the film.

6421,"Although a well produced made for television movie, Dying to Love You reeks with low grade melodramatic splendor.<br /><br />The film opens up to Roger Paulson (Tim Matheson, looking much older than I remember him to be), who is a struggling businessman that leads an empty, lonely life after his wife Ruthie (who looks suspiciously like Roseanne Arnold) leaves him with the quickness.

She ties him to the bed and seduces him.<br /><br />Roger is just so stupid that he does not realize that Johnnie-Eliane is just a bimbo that loves to sleep around. God forbid women only sleep with one man. Soon enough, strange phone calls begin to occur, Johnny Girl wants Roger to marry her with absolute quickness, and she keeps ranting and raving about her ex-husband who used to beat her. It's funny to see Roger believe her through all this stuff. That's until a frumpy co-worker tells him to go snooping through her belongings like a nosy housewife. He takes her crappy advice and lo and behold, he finds a suitcase crawling with fake ID cards and wigs and guns and a crossbow. He immediately takes the suitcase to the police and has her arrested.

The reviewer mocks the film's attempts at romance, calling the phone sex scene ""trashy"" and the romance between Roger and Johnnie/Lisa ""whirlwind"" and unconvincing. The reviewer also criticizes Roger's character, calling him ""stupid"" for believing Lisa's lies and not realizing her true nature sooner. The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and dismissive, with phrases like ""God forbid women only sleep with one man"" and ""IL' Rog is so stupid, he throws Lisa out and doesn't even change the locks.""

The only positive comments are brief and backhanded, such as praising Tracy Pollan's performance as ""trampy"" and Tim Matheson's status as a ""Made-for-TV-Movie king.""

6422,"Okay, so this was made way back in 1993. Directed loosely by Robert Iscove and written loosely by John Miglis, it's supposed to be based on a true story.

Can't believe someone would fall for that old line. But Mr. Matheson seemed to buy it. And it cost him plenty. <br /><br />The hardest scene to take was when he finally threw the dame out of his apartment, putting all her junk in the hallway (IN FRONT OF HIS APARTMENT) and then had the stupidity not to change the locks. That's when I had enough of this trite movie. It made me want to wish the dame had tried it on me so I could have the satisfaction of telling her to take a hike.<br /><br />I give this chestnut a 1 out of 100. That's how bad I thought it was. I guess you can't blame the actors. But they were awful. Did they actually try to play this with a straight face?",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is extremely negative, with the reviewer expressing disdain and frustration towards the film's storyline, characters, and actors. The reviewer believes the plot is implausible, with a protagonist who is ""empty-headed"" and ""stupid"" for falling for the manipulations of the female lead, Tracy Pollan's character. The reviewer is particularly annoyed by the phone sex aspect, considering it an outdated and clichéd trope. The reviewer's criticism extends to the actors, implying that they must have struggled to deliver their lines with a straight face.

The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and dismissive, with phrases like ""Hard to believe anyone could be so stupid and blind to the truth"" and ""Can't believe someone would fall for that old line."" The reviewer's anger and frustration culminate in a scathing conclusion, where they give the film a score of 1 out of 100 and express a desire to confront the female lead's character.

Although they acknowledge some positive aspects, such as a few effective killings and some humor, these are not enough to redeem the movie in their eyes. The main issue seems to be the inclusion of scenes from old movies featuring the killer, which the reviewer found annoying and distracting. The reviewer's overall assessment is harsh, with a low rating of 2/10, indicating a strong dislike for the film.

6424,"The ABC gears up it's repertory company for another unrealistic representation of rural Australia. Yes folks, it's all there Baca Bourke (Jeremy Sims,an actor of little talent) Fire hero , Lill (Libby Tanner plays Bronwyn Craig in the bush), Fifi (Nadia Townsend) town slut, preggers by Baca's brother Joe (I think). Then there's Uncle Geoff the, Big Daddy of Lost Springs. Uncle Geoff's scenes are like Tennessee Williams on speed. Only saving grace is Russian actress Natalia Novikova as Baca's loony missus. She is great. I can't understand why John Waters took the gig as Lilly's psychologist husband. Must have needed the money I expect!

Frankly, I'm ashamed.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing strong disdain for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC) production. The reviewer criticizes the show's unrealistic portrayal of rural Australia, labeling it as a ""lemon."" The cast is also heavily criticized, with the reviewer stating that Jeremy Sims, who plays Baca Bourke, is an actor of ""little talent."" The characters are stereotyped and reduced to simplistic labels, such as Fifi being the ""town slut"" and Uncle Geoff being the ""Big Daddy of Lost Springs."" The reviewer does find one redeeming quality in Natalia Novikova's performance as Baca's wife, but this is not enough to salvage the show.

The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and dismissive, with a sense of embarrassment and shame towards the production. The mention of John Waters, a well-known actor, taking a role in the show is seen as a surprise, with the reviewer speculating that he must have needed the money. The review concludes by encouraging readers to watch the show to see ""how bad an Aussie show can be,"" implying that it's a cautionary example of poor production quality.

6425,"Let me say at the outset that I'm not a very artistic person and that I don't ""get"" new art. That being said, this film is absolutely crazy, and in my opinion not crazy in a good way. Filmed entirely in black and white with a series of very loosely connected stories, Avida is a film for those who can look at modern art and say ""wow, I feel the energy and passion of this painting."" The only reason I give this film a 3 out of 10 is because I actually did manage to laugh at some parts, though mainly laughing at the sheer insanity of the film. Two of the characters throwing chairs on a lawn, as to do what these characters were doing, I have no idea. I wouldn't recommend this film to anybody.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is decidedly negative, with the reviewer openly admitting their lack of appreciation for avant-garde art and their confusion with the film's narrative structure. The reviewer describes the film as ""absolutely crazy"" and implies that it is pretentious, suggesting that only those who appreciate modern art for its perceived ""energy and passion"" would enjoy it. The reviewer's tone is dismissive, and they express frustration with the film's loose narrative and seemingly nonsensical scenes, such as characters throwing chairs on a lawn. The only redeeming quality mentioned is that the reviewer found some parts amusing, but this is largely due to the film's absurdity rather than any intentional humor.

The reviewer's conclusion is unequivocal, stating that they would not recommend the film to anyone. The rating of 3 out of 10 further reinforces the reviewer's negative assessment. Overall, the review suggests that the film is inaccessible and self-indulgent, catering to a niche audience that appreciates experimental art.

6426,"Avida is a game of words mingling life and eagerness, but I personally think this movie was overblown by its ambition and does not make justice to its title. It gathers a set of awkward characters united by unbelievable links. Furthermore, the way everything is connected at the end is, in my opinion, a bit pathetic. What remains of it was a set of images... an interesting one, but not enough to make this a good movie. <br /><br />I believe this film is supposed to be a comedy, but I surely didn't noticed! The nonsense and caricatural nature of the movie is actually the only good thing about it, but when it drags on an on and on it becomes no longer bearable.

The reviewer criticizes the film's ambition, suggesting that it falls short of its potential and fails to live up to its title. The characters are described as awkward and connected by unbelievable links, implying a lack of coherence and believability in the narrative. The reviewer also expresses dissatisfaction with the film's conclusion, labeling it ""pathetic"". The only redeeming quality mentioned is the film's visuals, but even this is not enough to redeem the movie as a whole.

The reviewer also questions the film's comedic intentions, stating that they did not find it funny. Instead, they describe the film's absurdity and caricatural nature as the only positive aspect, but even this becomes tiresome and unbearable as the film drags on. The reviewer's struggle to finish the movie and their uncertainty about whether it was worth the effort further emphasize their negative opinion.

6427,"If you are planning to schedule your program for a film festival, do not be misled by what it says in the booklet. This is a complete waste of time and energy. I have watched Bunuel, I have seen Dali, and admired them; but this isn't surrealism, this is not supposed to BE at all. Didn't they ever think about the reputation of human race while taking this picture? After we become extinct by global warming, these will be the remainings of our civilization. What if the aliens sample this as an example of our intellectual capital? With all due respect to the effort put in this, maybe it would be a good idea to terminate all the copies of this film - or whatever it is.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is an unbridled expression of disdain and disappointment towards the film in question. The reviewer begins by warning others not to be misled by the festival booklet's description, implying that the film is a complete waste of time. The tone is sarcastic and dismissive, with the reviewer questioning the filmmakers' intentions and the potential consequences of showcasing this film as a representation of human intellectual capital. The comparison to renowned surrealist artists like Bunuel and Dali serves to further emphasize the reviewer's disappointment and frustration.

The reviewer's language is hyperbolic, with phrases like ""complete waste of time and energy"" and ""terminate all the copies of this film"" conveying a strong sense of disapproval. The hypothetical scenario of aliens discovering this film as a representation of human civilization is a humorous yet scathing critique. The reviewer's tone is not only negative but also condescending, implying that the filmmakers have failed to meet even the most basic standards of quality.

To do so, Quentin must absorb all the knowledge of other immortals before this overlord, Korton, does.<br /><br />In short, this is pure crap, much like the Highlander sequels. Quentin is a fairly stupid character, constantly whining and moaning and bitching in a ""woe is me for I am a reluctant hero"" kind of way, and he never catches on to the fact that he's an immortal and can't be killed, at least not easily. Ramirez would have done better to ditch him and thwart Korton himself.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is extremely negative, expressing strong disdain for the film's protagonist, Quentin MacLeod, and the overall storyline.

The reviewer also implies that Quentin is unintelligent, stating that he fails to understand his own immortality. The reviewer's frustration with the character is palpable, and they suggest that Ramirez, the mentor, would have been better off without Quentin's involvement.

The review also draws unfavorable comparisons to the Highlander sequels, implying that this film is just as bad as those poorly received installments. The reviewer's language is harsh and dismissive, with phrases like ""pure crap"" and ""woe is me for I am a reluctant hero"" conveying a strong sense of disappointment and annoyance.

6429,"This movie had the biggest advertising campaign any movie ever had in Russia. ""Epic movie about Russian culture"", ""Great saga of Russian spirit"", endless articles and interviews. For me this movie was the biggest disappointment.

In the first part of the movie the story doesn't develop at all.

The reviewer criticizes the story's lack of development in the first part of the movie, and the festival scenes are seen as boastful and lacking in substance.

The reviewer also expresses disappointment in the director, Nikita Mikhalkov, who they respect for his previous work, but feel that this movie is an example of his ambition to be considered the ""Tzar"" of Russian cinema, rather than a genuine attempt to create a meaningful film.

6430,"I saw this ego-centric ""effort"" at achieving a film of ""epic"" status in the company of several native Russian family members. Five people gave 5 different reactions, from Mikhalkov worship to my cynicism.<br /><br />I saw a movie that looked like Mikhalkov took a lot of ""Canal +"" money, put some of it in his (and other's) pockets and turned the project over to a bunch of film students.

The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and dismissive, implying that the film is an ego-driven project that wasted a large budget. The reviewer points out inconsistencies in the film's style, citing multiple scenes that seem to have been directed by different people. The criticism extends to the film's portrayal of Russian life, which the reviewer's Russian family members found to be a caricature rather than an accurate representation.

The reviewer also mocks specific scenes, such as Julia Ormond's character's implausible ability to traverse Moscow in a short amount of time. The tone is one of cynicism and ridicule, with the reviewer implying that the film is a shallow, superficial portrayal of Russia. The only positive sentiment expressed is the pride of the Russian natives that a Russian director has managed to break into the ""big time,"" but even this is tempered by the criticism of the film's wastefulness and lack of authenticity.

6431,"Most critics have written devastating about that Michalkov-movie, but I wanted it to see myself. And, unfortunately, they are right. The film had the greatest budget ever in Russian movie history, two international stars, colorful mass scenes, apparently shot quite close to the Kremlin - but in the end it appears to be a nice, sweet nothing. You would not believe, that this director earlier has made masterpieces like Urga and Burnt By the Sun. The characters in the storyline are not convincing, neither Jane nor McCracken nor Andrej. Only general Radlov worth being mentioned. It remains on the surface all the time. Politically it is to me a glorification of the army, and especially the Russian one with values like honor and duty. And, having lived at least half a year in Siberia: My Russia is much more than the one that is depicted in Michalkovs movie. Regarding ""Burnt By The Sun"" by the same director as a no-question-10-points-movie, one of the best I ever seen in my entire life, I was totally disappointed by that one. Sorry.

The reviewer criticizes the characters, stating that they are not convincing, with the exception of General Radlov. The reviewer also takes issue with the film's political message, seeing it as a glorification of the Russian army and its values.

The reviewer's disappointment is heightened by their admiration for the director's previous work, particularly ""Burnt By the Sun,"" which they consider a masterpiece. In contrast, this film falls short of their expectations. While the reviewer acknowledges the director's talent for creating visually stunning scenes, this is not enough to redeem the film's shortcomings.

The tone of the review is one of disappointment and disillusionment, with the reviewer apologizing for their negative assessment. However, their criticism is constructive, highlighting the film's flaws and suggesting that it does not live up to the director's previous standards.

6432,"This movie suffers from the fact that for years Hollywood had no clue as to how to package Jackie Chan for the masses. His low-budget Hong Kong movies were all fast-paced kinetic thrillers that highlight his amazing gymnastic skills and talent for light comedy. His early Hollywood films stuck him in the same movies that were being packaged for Stallone or Chuck Norris. There is nothing about Chan's character in this movie that requires the character to be Asian except for his being the star. In his Hong Kong films Chan is never dull, with the movies being one rapid-fire martial arts sequence after another, but ""The Protector"" is lifeless throughout. Danny Aiello isn't given much to work with either and the lacking chemistry between the two probably is more a result of the script and direction than how the two actors got on together. Both have been better in worse movies. The best thing about the movie is the Hong Kong settings. The worst part is the appalling way that Jackie Chan comes off so colorless and drab. It wouldn't be until the made-in-Canada ""Rumble in the Bronx"" that the west would finally figure out how to make a good Jackie Chan movie.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is largely negative, criticizing the Hollywood film industry's inability to effectively showcase Jackie Chan's unique talents in his early American films. The reviewer argues that Chan's Hong Kong movies were fast-paced, kinetic, and showcased his impressive martial arts skills and comedic timing, whereas his early Hollywood films, including ""The Protector"", failed to capitalize on these strengths. Instead, Chan was cast in generic action movies that could have starred other actors like Stallone or Norris, with no consideration for his unique cultural background or talents. The reviewer also criticizes the lack of chemistry between Chan and co-star Danny Aiello, attributing this to the poor script and direction.

The review highlights the dull and lifeless nature of the film, with the only redeeming quality being the Hong Kong settings. The reviewer is particularly disappointed in how Chan is portrayed, describing him as ""colorless and drab"", a far cry from his usual energetic and charismatic on-screen presence. The reviewer concludes that it wasn't until the film ""Rumble in the Bronx"" that Hollywood finally figured out how to make a good Jackie Chan movie.

The reviewer's anger and frustration are palpable, with exaggerated expressions of outrage, such as the threat to jump out the window.

The reviewer also makes a comparison to a superior film, ""Police Story"" (1985), which is presented as a benchmark of quality that ""The Protector"" fails to meet. This contrast serves to further emphasize the reviewer's disappointment and reinforces the negative assessment of the film.

The only positive comment is made about Patty Duke's memorable exit, but it's not enough to redeem the film as a whole.

The reviewer's tone is somewhat playful, using phrases like ""camp-fest"" and ""TV's late-late show,"" which suggests that the film is more entertaining as a retro curiosity than as a serious work of science fiction. The two-star rating out of four further reinforces the negative assessment.

The reviewer notes that Merriwether shows a spark that she would later develop in other roles, and that Duke outshines more established actors.

Despite these minor positives, the review's overall tone is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer's criticism of the film taking center stage. The brevity of the review and the lack of specific details about the film's plot or themes also suggest that the reviewer did not find much worth discussing or analyzing.

The reviewer's tone is dismissive, implying that the film's ambition to cover multiple genres has led to a confusing and unsuccessful outcome.

The review highlights the film's convoluted plot, which involves aliens, western settings, and a mix of sci-fi, horror, and comedy elements. The inclusion of various characters, such as the sexy alien daughter and her human husband, as well as TV reporters and government agents, is seen as an attempt to fill time rather than contribute to a meaningful narrative.

The tone of the review is playful and mocking, suggesting that the film's plot is absurd and perhaps even laughable.

The reviewer's use of phrases like ""the real plot"" and the deadpan description of the events implies that the film's storyline is so outlandish that it's almost unbelievable. The review is not meant to be taken seriously, and the reviewer is likely poking fun at the film's absurdity.

6439,"This movie is about a group of women (perhaps not of the highest repute) who are heading to a small fort to take over a recently departed uncles property where they plan to set up shop. Upon arrival in a nearby city they find no one will go there (even though its only 15 miles away), so they walk. When they get there they find there are no soldiers but a good amount of people who have taken over use of the fort and built up a small city nearby. They soon find that something isn't right here and Fort McMillan (Ft. Doom as the locals call it) is in some serious trouble. <br /><br />Rather than go into the plot line I will make some comments about things I noticed about the movie. First off the acting is very flat, only a few of the people seem to be real enough to believe in. My first though was poor acting, but at the end I watched some of the outtakes and these same people became alive. So my only thought left is this is how the director wanted it. On top of the bad acting I have a great problem where the people don't react right to a given set of circumstances. Take for example no one would take them to Ft McMillan for any price even though its only 15 miles away. Yet when we arrive at the Fort we find it is well maintained by a decent population of people, all of whom must get supplies from some one, not to mention mail etc. It is supposed to take place in 1867, yet we can see the railroad car has electric lights (they aren't on at least) and a locomotive engine that is at least 30 years later, not one of the general style of locomotives so popular at that time. There are also places where you can see paved blacktop, (and maybe a car at one point, didn't want to bother to go back and look) and other anachronistic items. If they had followed the rules of the ""world"" they made and let the actors be actors it might have gotten a 4 from me instead of the 2 I gave it, and they rewritten it about 4 more times it might have done even better.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is predominantly negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with various aspects of the film. The reviewer criticizes the acting, stating that it is ""very flat"" and that only a few actors seem believable. However, after watching the outtakes, the reviewer suggests that the director may have intentionally directed the actors to perform in this manner, which raises questions about the director's vision and creative choices.

The reviewer also expresses frustration with the plot, pointing out inconsistencies and anachronisms that detract from the film's credibility. For example, the reviewer notes that the characters' reactions to certain situations seem unrealistic, and that the film's setting in 1867 is compromised by the presence of modern elements such as electric lights, locomotives, and paved roads. These errors undermine the film's authenticity and immersion.

The reviewer's tone is one of disappointment and frustration, implying that the film had potential but was ultimately let down by poor execution and attention to detail. The reviewer's criticism is not limited to the acting and plot, but also extends to the director's creative choices and the film's overall world-building.

The only positive comment is a faint praise for Billy Drago's performance as the town mortician, but even that is tempered by the fact that the role is described as ""thankless"" and ""pointless"". The reviewer also expresses disdain for the film's production values, describing the sets and costumes as cheap and inauthentic, likening them to a ""modern made western tourist trap"" and ""Party City"" respectively.

The review concludes with a strong recommendation to watch a different film, ""Ravenous"", implying that the reviewer found that film to be superior in quality. The tone of the review is dismissive and scornful, with the reviewer urging readers to avoid this film altogether.

6441,"An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!). The soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.<br /><br />But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable. Still, it was the SETS that got a big ""10"" on my ""oy-vey"" scale. I don't know where this was filmed, but were I to hazard a guess, it would be either an open-air museum, or one of those re-enactment villages, where everything is just a bit too well-kept to do more than suggest the ""real Old West"". Okay, so it was shot on a college kid's budget. That said, I could have forgiven one or two of the aforementioned faults. But taken all together, and being generous, I could not see giving it more than three stars.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is predominantly negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with various aspects of the film. While they acknowledge Billy Drago's talent for playing a ""dangerous nut-bag"" and the soundtrack being ""not terrible,"" these positives are vastly outweighed by the reviewer's criticisms. The acting, including that of professionals like Drago and Debbie Rochon, is deemed ""terrible,"" and the directing is considered even worse. The dialogue is likened to that of a ""chimp,"" implying a lack of sophistication and coherence. The camera work is also panned as ""barely tolerable."" 

The only aspect of the film that receives praise is the set design, which earns a ""10"" on the reviewer's ""oy-vey"" scale. However, even this is tempered by the suggestion that the film's low budget is evident in the overly pristine and artificial appearance of the sets. The reviewer's overall assessment is that the film's numerous flaws cannot be overlooked, and they would not give it more than three stars.

6442,"I bought this 'film' from a gas station in the 3.99 bin for one reason: Billy Drago, who is one of my favorite actors. He is terrifically creepy and good, but that's where it stops.

The acting besides Drago's is so bad I wanted to put the couch cushions over my ears, the production values are nonexistent and the script , I don't even know where to start.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs unless you are a die hard Drago fan like me.<br /><br />Terrible, shameful unforgivable.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is extremely negative, with the reviewer expressing strong disappointment and frustration with the film. The only redeeming quality mentioned is Billy Drago's performance, which is described as ""terrifically creepy and good.""

The reviewer's language is strong, using words like ""dirt cheap,"" ""gratingly awful,"" ""shameful,"" and ""unforgivable"" to describe the film.

The reviewer's tone is also dismissive, with a warning to potential viewers to ""avoid at all costs"" unless they are die-hard Billy Drago fans like themselves. The reviewer's use of hyperbole, such as wanting to cover their ears due to the bad acting, further emphasizes their strong negative reaction to the film.

6443,"Royal Rumble 1988 bored me pretty damn good. The rumble itself is pretty uneventful, filled with mid carders, and a winner that really had no point in winning, and why on earth did The Young Stallions Vs The Islanders main event? half the crowd left. Jessie Ventura sounds bored, through half the thing, and you can tell when he mentions he finds the development of Hogan Vs Andre more interesting. McMahon and Ventura don't have the chemistry of Gorilla and Jessie.<br /><br />Ricky Steamboat Vs Ravishing Rick Rude. Heavily disappointing match, with too many rest holds, and too much of a sluggish pace, sink this one. When it picks up like crazy in the last 5 minutes, it's too little, too late. Steamboat wins by DQ.<br /><br />2 1/2 /5<br /><br />Next is up Dino Bravo attempting to set a new bench press record, with Ventura spotting him. Horrendous segment, with no entertainment value what so ever. Ventura is not nearly enough to carry this segment, and even McMahon admitted it was boring. Controversy or not, I wasted enough time on this crap.<br /><br />0/5<br /><br />WWF Woman's Tag Team Championship.<br /><br />2 out of 3 falls.<br /><br />The Glamour Girls|C|/W Jimmy Hart. Vs The Jumping Bomb Angels. This is the best match of the night, no I'm not kidding!. Very exciting stuff for Woman's wrestling, and you'll be hard pressed to find stuff this good, now a days. The Jumping Bomb Angels were way over, and the crowd went ape sh*t for their title win.<br /><br />3/5<br /><br />Contract signing between Hulk Hogan and Andre The Giant. Hogan gets a decent pop, but there a few noticeable boo's for him, probably because its in Canada. A bit too drawn out for my liking, but it was necessary for the storyline. It got it's point across, and had some effective moments, but a lot of the times, I kept saying ""Get on with it"". Both sign, and Andre slams Hogan's head on the table, and pushes the table on him.<br /><br />2 1/2 /5<br /><br />Royal Rumble Match. Very weak Royal Rumble, probably due to awkward pacing, and the true lack of star power. I think Vince was testing the waters with this one, and it showed. Ventura seems uninterested, and I don't blame him. Crowd clearly wanted Roberts to win, yelling DDT almost every 5 minutes he was in there, and while Duggan got a good pop, I don't believe he was the winner they wanted, and where did this take his career? Nowhere. Bret's 1st ever Royal Rumble, and he made an impressive showing. It wasn't terrible, but it was quite lackluster, and it didn't have enough to make the show, considering this was what the show was based on.<br /><br />2 1/2 /5<br /><br />Hogan has an interview with Craig DeGeorge. Standard Hulkster interview, but not with the same craziness, and outrageous remarks he usually pulls.<br /><br />2/5<br /><br />Ted and Andre get interviewed. Andre claims he will deliver the Championship to Mr. Dibiase. Short, but effective.<br /><br />3/5<br /><br />2 out of 3 Falls.<br /><br />The Islanders Vs The Young Stallions. Crowd is completely dead for this, and half of them bolted for the exit's. It's quite dull, and had no business being in the main event. Jessie and Vince seem bored, and argue about other things while the match is taking place. Islanders win, due to taking advantage of Roma's injury.<br /><br />2/5<br /><br />Bottom line. Historically important I suppose, but there is really nothing to see here. This was just a starting cue for great things to come for The Royal Rumble, and while you can see glimpses of potential here, there is nothing on here, going out of your way to see.

They also pan the Ricky Steamboat vs. Ravishing Rick Rude match, calling it ""heavily disappointing"" and citing too many rest holds and a sluggish pace. The reviewer also dislikes the Dino Bravo bench press segment, calling it ""horrendous"" and lacking entertainment value.

The only match that receives praise is the WWF Women's Tag Team Championship match between The Glamour Girls and The Jumping Bomb Angels, which the reviewer calls ""the best match of the night"" and ""very exciting stuff."" However, even this match is not enough to redeem the overall event, which the reviewer describes as ""boring"" and lacking in star power.

6444,"With Al Jolson at the height of his popularity and Warner Brothers's the Jazz Singer having been the highest grossing film of 1927, it was inevitable that the other studios would churn out a few vehicles for their own Jolson-esquire characters. But while the Jazz Singer was a sensation for its being the first part-talkie, the Matinée Idol lacks the singing voice of its star (the now obscure Johnnie Walker), and has to make do with just his visual antics.<br /><br />The Matinée Idol was an early directorial assignment for the renowned Frank Capra. Capra's first couple of full-length features for Harry Langdon reveal a very showy, excessive style, which made Langdon's already mediocre slapstick almost unwatchable. A couple of pictures later and Capra has learnt to ease off a bit, with some fairly regular and decent camera-work. However he still shows no aptitude for shooting physical comedy. The longest comic routine - the stage performance - seems to have a few good gags, but it's all cut up into lots of different camera angles, and there is no chance for the comedy to flow naturally from the performances. Theoretically, a good portion of the jokes are in the intertitles, but there are far too many of these and none of them is especially funny.<br /><br />Of course, Capra would eventually mature into a fine dramatic and romantic director, and you can see him beginning to develop in this respect. He cuts down the line, closing in on Walker and Bessie love in the scene where she first lays eyes on him in his Don Wilson get up, neatly establishing the wordless connection between them. Then there is some beautiful and tender framing of the couple in their scene together at the masquerade, which is all very reminiscent of the love scenes in Capra's early 30s output.<br /><br />Johnnie Walker, Columbia's answer to Al Jolson, is not an exceptional talent. His comic timing is good but there is nothing to make him stand out. Bessie Love on the other hand is a pretty good actress too, with a very expressive face. Kudos to her for getting involved with the physical comedy and losing her dignity with the boys. There's also a good role for Lionel Belmore, that rotund and jolly character actor who seems to turn up in absolutely everything in the late 20s and early 30s.<br /><br />The Matinée Idol is one of those pictures that has gained more than its fair share of attention thanks to its director later having made a handful of masterpieces. In and of itself it is a very uninteresting piece, and like most of Capra's work before he met Robert Riskin, a disappointment.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review of ""The Matinée Idol"" is largely negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and unimpressed by the film's overall quality. The reviewer notes that the film lacks the singing voice of its star, Johnnie Walker, and relies heavily on visual antics, which are not enough to carry the film. The reviewer criticizes Frank Capra's direction, stating that he shows no aptitude for shooting physical comedy and that the camera work is excessive and showy. The reviewer also finds the intertitles to be unfunny and overly abundant.

However, the reviewer does acknowledge some positive aspects of the film, such as Capra's developing skills as a director, particularly in his handling of romantic scenes. The reviewer praises Bessie Love's performance, noting her expressive face and willingness to engage in physical comedy. Additionally, the reviewer appreciates Lionel Belmore's supporting role.

Despite these positives, the reviewer concludes that the film is uninteresting and a disappointment, particularly when compared to Capra's later masterpieces. The reviewer's tone is critical and dismissive, implying that the film's only significance is due to Capra's later success.

6445,"Role-reversal remake of 1942's ""The Major and the Minor"" has Jerry Lewis stepping into the part originally played by Ginger Rogers, but unfortunately this anemic outing is missing a lot more than just Ginger. Lewis attempts to pass for a child when boarding a train; he's successful, but the deception leads to a string of comic and romantic confusions. Sidney Sheldon adapted the screenplay, tossing in musical moments for Dean Martin (playing yet another in his stable of second-bananas) and a jewel-robbery subplot (which is dire). Diana Lynn, who played the wily teenager in the original film, plays Lewis' love-interest here. She's cute; Jerry isn't. *1/2 from ****",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is largely negative, criticizing the remake of ""The Major and the Minor"" for its shortcomings. The reviewer expresses disappointment that Jerry Lewis, who takes on the role originally played by Ginger Rogers, fails to bring the same level of charm and energy to the film. The plot, which involves Lewis attempting to pass as a child, is seen as weak and lacking in comedic momentum. The addition of musical moments featuring Dean Martin is also panned, and the jewel-robbery subplot is deemed ""dire"". The only positive comment is a brief mention of Diana Lynn, who plays Lewis' love interest, being ""cute"". However, this is not enough to redeem the film, which is ultimately given a low rating of *1/2 out of ****.

The reviewer's tone is dismissive and unimpressed, implying that the remake lacks the charm and wit of the original. The criticism is not limited to Lewis' performance, but also extends to the screenplay, adapted by Sidney Sheldon, which is seen as lacking in creativity and humor.

The reviewer starts by expressing a lukewarm opinion, stating that the movie ""isn't too bad"" until a major issue arises, specifically with the ending. The reviewer praises the film's visuals, considering it ""beautiful"" for its time. However, the main criticism lies in the significant deviation from the original book's theme and ending. The reviewer is disappointed that the movie's conclusion undermines the inspirational message of perseverance and determination, instead opting for a more pessimistic outcome.

The reviewer's tone becomes increasingly critical, labeling the film a ""desecration"" and implying that the filmmakers failed to do justice to the original material. The reviewer suggests that instead of remaking classic films, the industry should focus on redoing this particular film correctly. This criticism is not only directed at the film itself but also at the broader Hollywood system, which the reviewer perceives as lacking original ideas.

6447,"I hardly know where to begin.<br /><br />Huge continuity issues, bad acting, etc. For example, Sam is supposed to be far from any people yet you can see the ski slopes cut into the mountain next to his head.<br /><br />But the most fundamental problem is that the essence of the book, Sam's adventurousness paving the way to improve the lot of his entire family, is not even touched upon.

The reviewer lists several issues, including continuity problems, poor acting, and subpar production quality. They specifically point out an example of a continuity error, where the protagonist, Sam, is supposed to be isolated, but ski slopes are visible in the background. 

The reviewer's main concern, however, is that the film fails to capture the essence of the book, particularly Sam's character development and his efforts to improve his family's situation. Instead, the movie portrays Sam as someone who gets angry with his family and leaves, only to return home when he gets tired of being alone. The reviewer argues that this portrayal lacks the character arc and development present in the book.

The review concludes by stating that the film might be tolerable for an 8-year-old, but for anyone familiar with the book, it is a significant disappointment. The reviewer's final advice is to ""read the book instead,"" implying that the film adaptation is not worth watching.

The reviewer sets a stark contrast between the ""fabulous book"" and the poor movie adaptation, implying that the film failed to capture the essence and quality of the original novel.

The reviewer's criticism is not specific, but the overall tone and language used convey a strong sense of disappointment and disapproval. The comparison between the book and the movie is stark, with the book being described as ""fantastic"" and the movie being implied to be subpar.

The tone is confrontational, with the reviewer warning potential viewers to avoid the film altogether, advising them not to even consider renting it.

The reviewer's strong emotions and use of strong language (""Ouch,"" ""ugly,"" ""horrible"") convey a sense of betrayal and disappointment, implying that the filmmakers have failed to do justice to the original material.

6450,"I guess there are two ways to make a movie with kids as the intended audience. You can either say to yourself a) ""Let's make a movie that kids today will love!"" or b) ""Let's make a movie that I would have loved when I was a kid!"" The second approach explains why Steven Spielberg often make movies that appeal to a younger audience. Prime examples are E.T., The Goonies or Indiana Jones. That Darn Cat is an example of the first approach. You see these flat, unbelievable characters saying things that is supposed to be funny but isn't. The plot itself is enough for a ten minute short, but instead it goes on and on. And although I'm not a kid, I don't quite understand what in this movie is supposed to be fun for kids?

The reviewer contrasts this film with those made by Steven Spielberg, implying that Spielberg's films are more authentic and appealing to children because they are made with a sense of nostalgia and a genuine understanding of what kids enjoy. In contrast, ""That Darn Cat"" is seen as a shallow attempt to appeal to kids, with flat, unbelievable characters and a thin plot that is stretched out too long. The reviewer questions what exactly is supposed to be fun for kids in this movie, dismissing the comedic elements, such as the clumsy cops and the old lady with a tweety bird, as unfunny. The only redeeming aspect mentioned is the performance of Doug E. Doug, who brings some acrobatic humor to his role as an FBI agent.

Even the title song in the original film (both original version and the dubbed Italian version) was extremely nice and creating the mood for the story.

The reviewer's tone is somewhat sarcastic, implying that the film is only suitable for ""very undemanding children"" and that its shortcomings are evident.

The reviewer's positive comments about Chris Ricci's performance are tempered by their overall disappointment with the film. The reviewer's admission that they might be oblivious to the movie's flaws due to their admiration for Ricci suggests that their positive assessment is heavily influenced by her presence in the film.

The reviewer's criticism of the film's handling as ""heavy and lugubrious"" and the cat as ""lifeless"" further emphasizes the negative tone.

Although they mention enjoying the lead actress's performance, citing her ""priceless"" expressions, this is not enough to redeem the movie as a whole. The reviewer criticizes the film for being clichéd and predictable, with a drawn-out and unnecessary car chase scene that marks a shift towards crudeness, deviating from the initially ""family-friendly"" tone.

The reviewer also expresses disappointment with the underutilization of other cast members, such as Michael McKean, implying that their talents were wasted in this film. The only redeeming quality mentioned is the cat, which is described as ""somewhat amusing."" However, this is not enough to outweigh the reviewer's overall negative assessment of the movie.

The federal cop, Kelso was okay, but not as good as the one in the original. I guess Disney was trying to make Christina Ricci and Doug Doug (or whatever goofy name he has) into stars, but they don't hold a candle to Hayley Mills and Dean Jones in the original.

The reviewer criticizes the film's failure to focus on the cat, D.C., who is relegated to a sideline character, and instead centers on the human characters.

The reviewer also expresses disappointment with the casting, stating that Christina Ricci and Doug E. Doug are no match for Hayley Mills and Dean Jones from the original.

The reviewer's tone is scathing, implying that the remake is a poor attempt to recreate the original.

The reviewer initially enthused about the first film, but upon re-watching it with friends, felt ashamed of their earlier recommendation. The reviewer uses a vivid metaphor, comparing Disney's handling of the original film to the human body processing a meal, implying that the remake is a watered-down, unimpressive result.

The reviewer also criticizes the film's casting choice, specifically the inclusion of a dark-skinned FBI agent, which they believe toned down the impact of a key plot point involving fingerprinting. The reviewer's tone is one of disappointment and disillusionment, implying that the film failed to live up to their expectations.

The review concludes by stating that, as a standalone film, it might be tolerable for those who enjoy a particular type of movie, but for those familiar with the original or the book, the remake is a letdown.

Doug) she must find her.<br /><br />That Darn Cat is a bad movie. It is quite foolish and it has humor that often falls quite flat. There are, however, a few buds of talent in it. Doug E. Doug was good in Cool Runnings. His performance as `Senga' was really funny. Here he is wasted as the bumbling FBI agent. He does have a good scene when he imitates the cat, though. Micheal Mckean plays Patti's father. His character must be the most understanding parent to ever live. This poor guy has his expensive cigar crushed, gets arrested for picking up his own cat, and gets bitched-at by his snippy wife and STILL doesn't get angry at his daughter for causing all of his troubles. I wish my old man was like that. The only real good performance is Christina Ricci's. She entertaining as the ever-annoyed Patti, but her occasional very bad dialogue pulls her performance down. You might also recognize Peter Boyle (Young Frankenstein, Everybody Loves Raymond), the old lady from Wings and Cliff from Cheers, in this movie. This is a movie that all these actors would probably like to forget. Even the cat isn't very good... I really can't recommend 1997's That Darn Cat. Some young children (under 8) might enjoy it a bit, but every one else should look elsewhere. If you're looking for a good Christina Ricci movie, I suggest Addams Family Values, The Opposite of Sex or Sleepy Hollow. If a fun family film is what you're after, try Snow Day, instead.<br /><br />",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is predominantly negative, criticizing the film ""That Darn Cat"" for its foolishness, flat humor, and poor dialogue. The reviewer describes the movie as ""bad"" and states that it's a film that the actors involved would likely want to forget. While acknowledging a few redeeming qualities, such as Christina Ricci's entertaining performance as Patti, the reviewer notes that even her efforts are hindered by poor dialogue. The review also praises Doug E. Doug's past work in ""Cool Runnings"" but expresses disappointment in his underutilization in this film. The reviewer does appreciate Michael McKean's portrayal of Patti's understanding father, but this is not enough to redeem the movie as a whole.

The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and dismissive, implying that the film is only suitable for very young children (under 8) and advising readers to look elsewhere for a good family film or a strong Christina Ricci performance. The review concludes by recommending alternative movies, such as ""Addams Family Values,"" ""The Opposite of Sex,"" ""Sleepy Hollow,"" or ""Snow Day,"" implying that these films are superior to ""That Darn Cat.""

The reviewer's expectations were not met, as they anticipated a ""cute Disney movie"" similar to the original, but instead found the film to be subpar. The criticism is directed towards Christina Ricci's performance, implying that she is capable of better work, but was hindered by the film's shortcomings. The reviewer does offer some faint praise for Doug E. Doug's effort, suggesting that he did the best he could with the material provided. The review also implies that the film's appeal is limited to very young children, and even then, it may not be engaging enough to hold their attention.

6459,"I am really at a loss as to how anyone could give this movie a 10 (or even more than a 2!). It is full of bad lines, bad acting, bad slapstick, etc. I never thought I could see worse acting than the purposefully badly acted scenes at the beginning of UHF, but this was it. And just when you think it can't possibly get any worse, it does! Over and over again! You actually could have watched this in a theater? It wasn't worth free on TV! My 4-year-old and 1-year-old liked it some, but they wanted to see the cat more and the cat was almost never on.",Negative,negative,negative,negative,"This review is extremely negative, with the reviewer expressing utter disbelief that anyone could give the movie a high rating. The reviewer lists a multitude of criticisms, including poor dialogue, subpar acting, and unsuccessful slapstick humor. The comparison to the intentionally bad acting in the film ""UHF"" suggests that the reviewer finds the acting in this movie to be even more atrocious. The reviewer's tone is one of incredulity and frustration, with repeated expressions of disbelief that the movie could continue to deteriorate in quality.

The reviewer's personal experience with the movie is also telling, as they mention that even their young children, aged 4 and 1, were not engaged by the film and instead wanted to see more of the cat, which was barely featured. The reviewer's conclusion that the movie wasn't even worth watching for free on TV further emphasizes their strong dislike for the film.

They start by mentioning that the only entertaining aspect of their experience was overhearing the sound of Star Wars from another theater, implying that the movie they were watching was so bad that even a distant sound from another film was more engaging. The reviewer then proceeds to compare the movie unfavorably to the original, stating that the original was charming, funny, and well-acted, while the new version is ""mind numbingly bad."" They specifically criticize the acting, stating that Christina Ricci cannot compare to Hayley Mills, and that Doug E. Doug is no match for Dean Jones, who had a small but redeeming role in the new version.

The reviewer's language is hyperbolic and sarcastic, with phrases like ""I would rather have my eyes scratched out by a cat"" and ""hope that your eyeballs will fall out"" emphasizing their strong dislike for the movie.

The reviewer's criticism is multifaceted, targeting various aspects of the film. They argue that the cat, supposedly the main attraction, is underutilized and lacks memorable scenes. The reviewer also expresses annoyance with Christina Ricci's character, finding her more irritating than amusing. Furthermore, they believe that Doug E. Doug's role is underwritten, and even the usually reliable Dean Jones is unable to salvage the film. The only redeeming aspect, according to the reviewer, is the brief appearances of the town's auto mechanics, but even this is not enough to redeem the movie as a whole.

6462,"This is definitely a ""lesser known"" comedy short from the 1920s. The only reason I saw it was because it was on a DVD by Kino Films featuring non-Laurel and Hardy shorts featuring Ollie. They are interesting and historically important, but also generally average to below average for the style film. Compared to shorts by Chaplin, Keaton, Arbuckle and Lloyd, they are definitely a step below them in quality and humor.

But, despite this, they are still worth seeing.<br /><br />I've gotta be honest about this short. It was the last of 8 on this DVD and by the time I got to it, I was pretty bored with the mediocrity of 7 of the 8 shorts.

6463,"Not too long ago I bought a cheap VHS tape entitled ""Just Rambling Along"" supposedly featuring Laurel and Hardy. Being somewhat familiar with their output and not recognizing this title, I made the agonizing decision to part with a whole dollar and buy it. Upon playing it, I identified the film as HOP TO IT. Of course, Mr. Laurel was nowhere in the cast, making the packaging of this product criminally deceptive. Even worse, the quality is terrible. It looks like it was duped from an 8mm film source. It did have a somewhat appropriate musical score. Actually, in all seriousness, the tape is worth a buck if you just want to get an idea of what the movie is like.

The reviewer does acknowledge that the musical score is somewhat fitting, but overall, the reviewer's tone is critical and warning, advising potential buyers to be cautious.

However, the reviewer does provide some redeeming qualities, stating that the tape might be worth the dollar price if one wants to get an idea of what the movie is like, and that the short film itself is ""decent but unexceptional."" The reviewer also takes an interest in the historical context, noting that ""Just Rambling Along"" was the title of a 1918 Stan Laurel film, and suggests that IMDb should add it as an alternate title for the film.

6464,"On one Thursday evening at 10:00pm, my local west coast ABC affiliate aired the pilot episode of ""Northern Exposure"". The ABC Network usually airs ""Men In Trees"" in that time slot but the program was preempted for a live sporting event.<br /><br />Despite both shows are set in Alaska and filmed on location in the Pacific Northwest (Exposure in Washington state, Trees in Vancouver, BC), re-watching ""Northern Exposure"" (as well as few episodes of ""Sex and the City"") reminds me how disappointed I am with the poorly conceived hybrid ""Men in Trees"". <br /><br />Anne Heche can be a good actress with the right material. Unfortunately her role as a writer who ends up in a small town in Alaska grates on my nerves. Perhaps because I feel that Heche is miscast, I am not convinced of her ""fish-out-of-water"" character.<br /><br />I also cannot help but feel that the supporting cast fits the typical quirky stereotypes.

The supporting cast is also panned for relying on quirky stereotypes, with the exception of Abraham Benrubi's role, which is seen as a refreshing departure from typical casting.

The reviewer's tone is one of disappointment and frustration, implying that the show has potential but fails to live up to it. The criticism is not entirely scathing, as the reviewer acknowledges that the show has its dedicated viewers and fits a specific niche. However, the overall assessment is that the show lacks originality and relies too heavily on borrowed ideas from better shows.

The town only has one pilot who is not often available. Ther is only one radio show. And the entire show is about quirky people with sincere and odd relationships. Too many parallels. Just like Northern Exposure except one obvious demographic has been altered in each character. I'm bored. Give me something new to think about.<br /><br />On the upside, the writing is pretty good.

The reviewer perceives ""Men in Trees"" as a blatant copycat, with identical character archetypes and plot elements, such as the fish-out-of-water city dweller in a remote town, the initial conflict with a local, and the quirky townspeople. The reviewer feels that the show lacks originality and creativity, likening it to plagiarism.

The only positive comment made is that the writing is ""pretty good"", but this is not enough to redeem the show in the reviewer's eyes.

6466,"This show is awesome and we have been enjoying it thoroughly. Set in Alaska, I don't agree with the homosexual content on tonight's show. I feel that you are pushing too hard to bring New York to Alaska. Its one thing to have a New Yorker struggling in the Alaska wild, but to try to turn the Alaska town into New York? This is a nice show about dainty women and true Alaska Men and to bring a same sex couple into the mix is throwing the balance way off. Alaska should be Portrayed as a man and New York as the woman. I think the first 9 shows have the perfect balance with what you all are doing. Can't we have a nice show without the imbalance of nature.",Negative,Negative,Negative,negative,"This review is primarily positive, with the reviewer expressing their enjoyment of the show and appreciation for its portrayal of Alaska and its characters. However, the reviewer takes issue with a specific aspect of the show, namely the inclusion of a same-sex couple in a recent episode. The reviewer feels that this addition disrupts the balance of the show and introduces an unwanted element of ""New York"" culture into the Alaskan setting. The reviewer's tone is somewhat nostalgic, yearning for a more traditional and conservative portrayal of Alaska and its people.

Despite this criticism, the reviewer's overall assessment of the show remains positive, with praise for the first nine episodes and a desire to see the show continue in its original vein. The reviewer's negative reaction to the inclusion of a same-sex couple is a significant aspect of the review, but it does not overshadow their overall enthusiasm for the show.

6468,"I was recommended this movie by one of my film-making friends, and was therefore expecting something good. Sadly, I was very disappointed by the first half -- ah, a movie about a wimp taking revenge on their a**hole boss, how original -- and watched the second half on fast forward hoping to find something that would justify the 45-odd minutes I'd already wasted. But all I got was the 'shock' ending...<br /><br />The basic problem is that this is a movie which seems unable to decide what it wants to say, and says whatever it does say (hard to tell what that is) badly. Great acting does not save a bad script full of characters I can't care about.<br /><br />Now maybe if I didn't moonlight in the movie industry I'd be shocked to discover the dumb politics and exploitation going on behind the screen, but as it is my feelings are as summed up above: 'Ho Hum'.<br /><br />2/10... would have been 1/10 if it weren't for the acting and the paper cut scene.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with the film. The reviewer was initially expecting a good movie due to a recommendation from a filmmaking friend, but was let down by the unoriginal and clichéd plot, particularly in the first half. The reviewer's criticism is not limited to the storyline, as they also express dissatisfaction with the script, character development, and the film's inability to convey a clear message. The reviewer's tone is dismissive, with phrases like ""Ho Hum"" and ""waste of time,"" implying that the film is unremarkable and uninspired.

The only redeeming qualities mentioned are the acting and a specific scene involving a paper cut, which prevented the reviewer from giving the film the lowest possible score. However, these positives are vastly outweighed by the reviewer's numerous criticisms, resulting in a low rating of 2/10.

6469,"The role of Buddy Ackerman is no stretch for Kevin Spacey. He's played version of that character many times other, better films. This is fortunate because it gives his performance a certain resonance without which Buddy would be as flat and incomplete as all of the other characters in this pointless little farce.

The difference is that here the ""good stuff"" isn't people pleasuring each other but inflicting pain, making it appropriate viewing for young adults.<br /><br />Of course there's nothing wrong with a porn flick if you want to watch people having sex, and I guess there's nothing wrong with ""Swimming with Sharks"" if you want to watch people undergoing physical, emotional, and psychological torture.

The reviewer suggests that the film's rush to get to the ""good stuff"" (i.e., the violent and torturous scenes) comes at the expense of plot and character development, making it a shallow and unengaging experience. The only redeeming quality mentioned is Kevin Spacey's performance as Buddy Ackerman, but even that is diminished by the reviewer's assertion that it's a familiar role for Spacey and doesn't elevate the film as a whole.

The reviewer's tone is dismissive and sarcastic, implying that the film is only suitable for a specific type of audience looking for a particular kind of entertainment (i.e., watching people undergo torture). The comparison to a porn flick is meant to be derogatory, implying that the film is exploitative and lacking in substance. The reviewer concludes by advising readers to look elsewhere for a more engaging and thought-provoking cinematic experience.

6470,"Talk about false advertising! What was this doing in the comedy section of my video rental place? I think there was maybe one laughable part in the movie. I can appreciate black comedy, but this had only the blackness without any comedy. The movie was generally disturbing and un-funny. Yes, Kevin Spacey was good as Buddy and the rest of the cast was also good, but generally the movie falls apart because we don't really see a good enough reason for Guy (Whaley) to lose his mind so badly. The ending was disappointing as well. What would Buddy's motivation be for letting Guy get away with what he did? This isn't really explained AT ALL. Why would Buddy go for such a plan? Wouldn't it be more like Buddy to screw Guy completely by turning him over to the police? The ending didn't seem to make a whole lot of sense to me no matter how I looked at it.<br /><br />Generally, I disliked the film despite the good acting.

The main issue is the misleading categorization of the movie as a comedy, as the reviewer found it to be disturbing and unfunny, with only one potentially laughable moment. The reviewer praises the acting, particularly Kevin Spacey's performance, but criticizes the storyline and character motivations. The reviewer questions the reasoning behind the characters' actions, specifically Buddy's decision to let Guy get away with his actions, which is left unexplained. The ending is also deemed unsatisfying and illogical.

The reviewer's tone is one of disappointment and annoyance, feeling misled by the film's marketing as a comedy. Despite acknowledging the strong performances, the reviewer's overall assessment is that the story falls short, making the film unenjoyable.

6471,"There's something wonderful about a ""revenge"" film. Everyone wakes up in the morning believing he/she is the star of ""the movie,"" and that anyone who interferes with one's own personal agenda is in some way the enemy. Revenge plot films work particularly well if a person has low self-esteem. Rather than fighting back in the moment, the ""hero"" draws upon built-up inner anxiety to engage in a single act of power in an attempt to restore equilibrium. Quite naturally, in the ""real world"" this type of revenge seldom relieves the tension because life is not a movie; after the revenge is enacted the actions taken have their own consequences. A good revenge flick helps people ignore this bitter pill. In the movies the end credits roll and all responsibility resolved.<br /><br />""Swimming With Sharks"" is advertised as a comedy, no doubt an act on the part of the producers to figure out just how to sell this oddity. It's dark, but it isn't dark comedy (""Company Of Men"" and the works of Todd Solondz come much closer). Parts of the film are so brutal they pre-date the current ""torture-porn"" genre everyone is so obsessed with (""Saw"", ""Hostel""). There are some laughs. There are laughs in ""Saving Private Ryan"" too, but it isn't labeled comedy.<br /><br />The intrinsic problem with this film is that it hasn't earned its revenge case. It is ostensibly about a young man who is abused by his boss and eventually takes his boss hostage to ""pay him back"" for all the mistreatment. The hero (aptly named ""Guy"") is an ""everyman"" so vague we know literally nothing about him...what does he do with his spare time? Does he have friends/family? How did he get where he is? What are his interests (this becomes a running motif through the film, no doubt inspired by the film's author's own struggle...""What do you want?"", the answer to which we are denied by a vague, cheat of an ending)? It's very difficult to care for such a character, even if acted well (even Tom Hanks becomes a creep in the wrong roll, such as ""Punchline""). Kevin Spacey as the boss, ""Buddy,"" is supposed to be a monster but he's too charismatic as an actor. The best laughs came when he abused his assistant--he seemed almost as surprised as the audience probably is at what Guy will endure. When Kevin's character is being tortured, the view taken suddenly becomes empathy for him. Guy is suddenly filmed as a leering monster without rationality. At this point any message the author had has been lost; there's no ""hero"" in this film, ergo, no reason to care at all.<br /><br />It's not a stretch to assume this story is based on the author's own troubled career in the film business. I worked for a similar boss and can vouch that it's not that far-fetched. I had similar wish-fulfillment fantasies at that time and thought that I was justified. I thought you could win over the most beautiful woman in the story (actually, the ONLY woman--there seem to be all of about four people in the universe of this film) just by being your eager, naive self, that eagerness won accolades and that a boss abused you because he was a mean person. Time and tide have revealed the truth that most ""monsters"" are really just the demons of an individual's personal psyche and resentment is usually based in the self. As the film points out, if Guy was so unhappy he only had to leave. The film doesn't offer any denouement at all, ""surprise"" ending notwithstanding. We still know nothing about the protagonists, we can't even be sure anything they said was based in fact and everyone magically gets to have his cake and eat it too. In short, there was no point to this story at all other than to point out that (shock!) the film business can be pretty brutal.<br /><br />There are plenty of good films that tell solid and satisfying revenge-style fantasies, both the feel-good variety (""9-to5,"" ""Working Girl,"" ""The Devil Wears Prada"") and not so much (""War Of The Roses"", the remake of ""The Hills Have Eyes""). This isn't one of them--despite a fun turn by Benicio Del Toro in the Emily Blunt role from ""Prada"" and some interesting work by Spacey and Michelle Forbes, this is a frustrating, mean, confused and slightly dull creation of self- indulgence from a director who has, one hopes, ""worked it all out"" by now...",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is predominantly negative, criticizing the film ""Swimming With Sharks"" for its failure to effectively execute a revenge plot. The reviewer argues that the film's protagonist, Guy, is poorly developed, making it difficult for the audience to care about his character. The reviewer also criticizes the film's portrayal of the boss, Buddy, played by Kevin Spacey, as a charismatic figure, which undermines the intended message of the film. The reviewer suggests that the film's author may have drawn from their own experiences in the film industry, but the execution falls short.

The reviewer's tone is critical, pointing out the film's flaws, such as the lack of character development, the inconsistent tone, and the unsatisfying ending.

Yes, he could play this part in his sleep but he does it so well, he's such a joy to watch, so believable and marvellously monstrous. Enjoy it for his performance, but don't expect anything else from this movie. If you want to see a great film about the evils of modern Hollywood, check out Robert Altman's ""The Player"". This sad little potboiler is not remotely in the same league.",Negative,"Mixed, but overall: Negative",Negative,negative,"This review is a mixed bag, with the reviewer expressing both strong criticism and admiration for the film. On the negative side, the reviewer describes the film as ""ugly, heartless Hollywood crap"" that expects a similar response from its audience. They also imply that the film's quality is poor, stating that the scenes without Kevin Spacey's presence reveal the film's true awfulness. Furthermore, the reviewer suggests that the film is inferior to Robert Altman's ""The Player"", implying that it lacks depth and insight into the Hollywood industry.

On the other hand, the reviewer praises Kevin Spacey's performance, describing it as ""entertaining"" and ""marvellously monstrous"". They acknowledge that Spacey could play the part in his sleep, but still manages to deliver a compelling and believable performance. The reviewer's tone suggests that Spacey's presence is the only redeeming quality of the film, making it worth watching solely for his performance.

Despite the criticism, the reviewer's admiration for Spacey's performance tips the balance in favor of a positive review. However, the reviewer's negative comments and comparisons to a superior film temper the overall assessment, making it a mixed but ultimately positive review.

6474,"I tried to like this movie. I love Kevin Spacey and I knew the other guy from his role as ""Big Brain on"" Brad in Pulp Fiction. But I just didn't care about the characters at all. Kevin Spacey is a prick through the whole movie and even finding out some horrible things that happened to him, I didn't like him. Especially the ending---that made me hate him even more. This was like watching a bad car wreck. Spacey played a prick well (he does it all well), but other than that, I don't recommend it.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is predominantly negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with the film. Despite their admiration for Kevin Spacey and the other actor from Pulp Fiction, they failed to connect with the characters, particularly Spacey's character, who is portrayed as a ""prick"" throughout the movie. The reviewer's inability to empathize with the character, even after learning about his traumatic past, suggests that the film's character development fell short. The reviewer's use of the phrase ""bad car wreck"" to describe the viewing experience implies a sense of morbid fascination, but not in a positive way. The only faint praise is for Spacey's acting skills, but even that is not enough to redeem the film in the reviewer's eyes.

6475,"Ill-tempered, verbally abusive movie studio chief runs his male assistant ragged with nit-picking requests, keeping the young man firmly under his thumb with constant threats of unemployment; after a year of office-terror, the working stiff finally cracks. Writer-director George Huang has possibly bit off more than he can chew here. His ""Swimming With Sharks"" isn't a diatribe against Hollywood, nor is it a tribute to the hard-working underling...instead, it's stunt film-making with a twist, a one-trick pony with tunnel-vision. The surroundings don't look or feel like Tinsel Town (perhaps due to a limited budget), and we never get a sense of this stressful environment as a movie-making entity (it could be a realtor's office in the Valley, for all we know). Lead Kevin Spacey, who also served as one of the film's producers, gives a controlled and focused performance as the power-mad mogul whose ego is out of control; he does good work, and yet the character doesn't ring true. We learn so little about him and his acquaintances that his important position and high-ranking status fail to jibe with what we do see; who does this man answer to? what drives him beyond humiliating others for sport? what projects is he juggling aside from the one script we see passed around? The film is so emotionally stunted and underpopulated, it begins to seem like a stage-play padded out for the big screen--and yet one without enough characters or motivations in it. Perhaps Huang wanted to keep things simple, but instead his movie looks like a half-baked project which needed a lot more insight, humor, and atmosphere. ** from ****",Negative,Negative,Negative,negative,"This review is largely negative, criticizing the film ""Swimming With Sharks"" for its shortcomings in storytelling, character development, and atmosphere. The reviewer argues that writer-director George Huang has bitten off more than he can chew, attempting to create a complex film that ultimately falls flat. The reviewer praises Kevin Spacey's performance as the power-hungry mogul, but notes that the character lacks depth and motivation, making it difficult to understand his actions and position of power. The film's setting, supposedly a Hollywood movie studio, feels unrealistic and lacks the sense of a stressful environment, which further detracts from the film's credibility.

The reviewer's criticism extends to the film's simplicity, lack of characters, and underdeveloped plot, making it feel like a padded-out stage play. The review concludes that the film needed more insight, humor, and atmosphere to make it a compelling watch. The two-star rating out of four further emphasizes the reviewer's disappointment with the film.

6476,"This movie was a low point for both Jason Robards and Sam Peckinpah. Major plot points are taken directly from Sergio Leone's masterpiece ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" (released two years earlier and also featuring Robards): A man finds a watering hole is found in the desert, being the only water for many miles in every direction, he plans to build a 'station' around the hole and to ensure there's a love interest, he falls in love with a prostitute. To this add an intemperate preacher, bad music, silly fast action shots, even sillier T&A shots - and there you go. There is little question why it failed at the box office. The real question is ""how did it make it that far?"".",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is extremely negative, criticizing the film for its unoriginality, poor plot, and lack of quality. The reviewer accuses the film of borrowing major plot points from Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West"", implying that the filmmakers lacked creativity and originality. The review also criticizes the film's execution, mentioning ""bad music"", ""silly fast action shots"", and ""sillier T&A shots"", suggesting that the film's technical aspects are subpar. The reviewer's tone is dismissive and sarcastic, questioning how the film even made it to release.

The review also implies that the film's failure at the box office was well-deserved, and that it's surprising it made it that far in the first place. The mention of Jason Robards and Sam Peckinpah, both respected figures in the film industry, serves to further emphasize the film's shortcomings, implying that even their involvement couldn't salvage the project.

6477,"Tug-3 is absolutely right. Although I am sure that Mr. Osmond wanted to make a sincere, heartwarming Christmas movie, this one is as cynical and creepy as they come. The religious significance of Christmas is forgotten and replaced with cute kids, clueless grownups, and dopey villains. The production values demonstrate that this was either filmed on a shoestring or by truly inexperienced filmmakers-- I suspect the latter, unfortunately. The worst part, oddly enough, really is the music. You would think someone with a long-standing musical career could do better than the title song, but you would be wrong. Even my mom didn't like this movie, and she likes the Osmonds AND sappy stuff.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is extremely negative, criticizing almost every aspect of the movie. The reviewer accuses the filmmakers of being cynical and creepy, implying that they prioritized superficial elements like ""cute kids"" and ""dopey villains"" over the true meaning of Christmas. The production values are also panned, with the reviewer suggesting that the filmmakers were inexperienced or worked with a very low budget. The music, which one would expect to be a strong point given the Osmonds' musical background, is particularly criticized, with the title song being singled out as subpar.

The reviewer's tone is scathing, and even mentions that their mom, who is a fan of the Osmonds and enjoys sentimental content, didn't like the movie. This implies that the film failed to resonate with its target audience. The reviewer's language is strong, using words like ""cynical"", ""creepy"", and ""dopey"" to describe the movie, leaving no doubt about their negative opinion.

6478,"This gawd-awful piece of tripe is all over the place. The script is bad, the plot is bad, the acting is bad. There are a couple of decent actors in it (Charles Durning, eg.), but the director got nothing out of them. The plot line has Santa, feeling dejected and thinking no one needs him any more, taking a little girl across country to try to get her father back together with her mother. It includes a con-man in a Santa suit with a stuffed parrot on his shoulder (played by ""Isaac"" from The Love Boat), the world's largest elf (played by Bruce Vilnach - a very funny man, but no actor), a hardened factory owner who works his employees overtime on Christmas eve, and a sleigh race where someone cuts one of Santa's skis trying to win. If the plot sounds bad, it's worse on the little screen. If you see this movie coming up next, run, do not walk, to your television and unplug it. You may want to boil your television to remove any remaining infection. If you accidentally watch more than 10 minutes of this, you may have to burn your television, and have the cable company install entirely new lines.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is extremely negative, with the reviewer expressing their strong dislike for the film. They criticize every aspect of the movie, calling the script, plot, and acting ""bad."" The reviewer also mocks the plot, describing it as ridiculous and nonsensical, with a convoluted storyline involving Santa, a con-man, and a sleigh race. They even go so far as to advise readers to avoid the movie at all costs, suggesting that watching it could be harmful to one's television and even requiring drastic measures to remove the ""infection.""

The reviewer's tone is sarcastic and humorous, with exaggerated language and hyperbole used to emphasize their dislike for the film. The mention of specific actors, such as Charles Durning, is not meant to praise their performance but rather to lament that even talented actors were unable to elevate this poor material. The reviewer's overall assessment is that this movie is a complete waste of time and should be avoided at all costs.

Answer: Negative"
6479,"Amanda Bynes is an enormously talented actress, and I've really enjoyed all of her roles in the past, especially in the fantastic ""She's the Man."" For that reason alone, ""Sydney White"" was a huge disappointment for me. The real reason for my dislike of this film is the poor use of characters. In a good fun teen comedy, its perfectly alright to have a cast of all fairly reality-based teen characters. In ""Sydney White,"" this idea is thrown out the window.<br /><br />Amanda Bynes makes a fine Sydney, but she is really lacking in a lot of what usually makes her sparkle as an actress. I blame this on the script, which makes her character too bland and restrained, and on the hair/makeup department, which gives her a detestable plastic look and an annoying hair style. The seven ""dorks"" that Sydney eventually befriends are far worse. They are so dorky that it's impossible to like them or even respect them as characters. They're essentially repulsive gag fodder. As is the story's ""Prince Charming,"" who is completely unbelievable as a character and is about as cheesy as can be.<br /><br />Perhaps the film's biggest star-to-be (with the possible exception of Amanda Bynes) is Sara Paxton, who's actually very good as the conniving Rachel Witchburn. It's just a shame that the script-writers didn't make her a bit more gray than black.<br /><br />The plot is basically that of ""Snow White."" What kills it is that it is too blunt and obvious a re-imagining. The connections to ""Snow White"" are thrown at us so much throughout the film that they are ultimately annoying and overblown. Prince Charming is unrealistically charming, the ""witch"" is far too despicably witchy, the seven ""dorks"" are too dorky, and Sydney is just too pure of heart. Now, this is not to say that the movie is all bad. Though Bynes is forced down by the script, she still has her moments. As does Sara Paxton, who brings physical comedy to the max in her scenes. Sydney's room-mate, named ""Dinky"" is also great fun as a character. It's a somewhat funny film at parts that is ultimately just too cheesy and clichéd to recommend.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review of ""Sydney White"" is largely negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with the film's poor character development, script, and overall execution. The reviewer, who is a fan of Amanda Bynes, is let down by the film's failure to utilize her talents effectively, instead relegating her to a bland and restrained character. The supporting characters, particularly the ""seven dorks,"" are criticized for being overly caricatured and unlikable. The plot, which is a modern retelling of ""Snow White,"" is deemed too obvious and heavy-handed, with characters that are too one-dimensional and clichéd.

While the reviewer does acknowledge some positive aspects, such as Sara Paxton's performance and a few humorous moments, these are not enough to redeem the film's overall shortcomings. The reviewer's tone is critical and disappointed, implying that the film had potential but failed to deliver.

6480,"I rated this one better than awful because I liked seeing Jonathon from Buffy in something again -- even if it was the same role.<br /><br />First, the concept is kind of cute for a short, but not an entire movie. The writing was forced and contrived. I have the feeling that the movie suffered the most during editing.<br /><br />Second, Amanda Bynes always looks like her eyes are crossed -- even when she's not trying to do it. She's just not funny. She always plays some sort of misfit girl who triumphs by being herself -- ironic, considering Amanda seems to always be a caricature. I would actually like to see her in something serious. I really want to give her a chance, but she is always cast in these trite roles where she wiggles and makes faces and somehow that's a good thing?<br /><br />Finally, the whole ""I'm a Dork"" segment was ripped off from Revenge of the Nerds. There was nothing in this movie that was unpredictable.<br /><br />Shame, shame, shame.",Negative,Negative,negative,negative,"This review is predominantly negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and frustration with the film. The reviewer starts by mentioning that they only gave the movie a slightly higher rating than ""awful"" because they enjoyed seeing an actor from Buffy in a new role, but this positive sentiment is short-lived. The reviewer then proceeds to criticize the film's concept, stating that it would have been better suited for a short film rather than a full-length feature. They also express dissatisfaction with the writing, calling it ""forced and contrived,"" and speculate that the editing process may have contributed to the film's shortcomings.

The reviewer is particularly scathing in their assessment of Amanda Bynes' performance, implying that she always plays the same type of character and that her comedic style relies on making faces and wiggling. They express a desire to see her in a more serious role, suggesting that she may have untapped potential. The reviewer also accuses the film of ripping off a scene from Revenge of the Nerds, further emphasizing their perception of the movie's lack of originality.

The tone of the review is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer using phrases like ""Shame, shame, shame"" to express their disappointment. The reviewer's criticism of the film's concept, writing, and performances, as well as their accusations of unoriginality, make it clear that they did not enjoy the movie.

6481,"My 15 year old daughter asked me to watch this movie with her on Cable TV. As someone who saw Revenge of The Nerds in a movie theater, I found this movie to be an extremely predictable remake of it. The Nerds were simply replaced by Dorks. I drove her crazy by being able to predict precisely what would happen in each scene. The cast was cute, especially Amanda Bynes.<br /><br />Screenwriter Chad Creasey should be ashamed for writing such an obvious remake of an early 1980's flick. The title should have simply been ""Revenge of The Dorks.""

The reviewer, who had seen the original ""Revenge of the Nerds"" in theaters, found the movie to be an unoriginal remake, with the main characters simply being replaced by ""Dorks"" instead of ""Nerds"". The reviewer's ability to predict the plot and scenes with ease is seen as a testament to the film's predictability and lack of creativity. The only positive comment made is about the cast, particularly Amanda Bynes, being ""cute"". However, this is not enough to redeem the film's overall lack of originality.

The reviewer's tone is critical, with a sense of annoyance and disappointment. The suggestion that the screenwriter, Chad Creasey, should be ""ashamed"" of writing such an obvious remake implies a strong disapproval of the film's lack of creativity. The sarcastic comment about the potential sequel title, ""Revenge of the Dorks 2"", further emphasizes the reviewer's negative opinion of the film.

18520,"William M. Thackeray once said ""A good laugh is sunshine in the house."" When I watched Take Away, I must say that the sun did shine in my house. This film was superb, the opening was very cleverly done, the story held together well, in a nutshell two fish'n chip shop owners who normally enemies are forced to form an alliance of sorts to engage in a David and Goliath struggle against a fast food chain which builds a restaurant on their street. The ending was hilarious even though I have found many who disagree with me on that one.<br /><br />The film was though very discreetly, portraying contemporary Australian ethnic stereotypes, in particular the collision or culture clash if you will between the traditional Anglo Australian and Italo Australian stereotypes, and how they found a sort of ""unity though adversity"", very nice.<br /><br />I found Vince Colosimo's performance as ""Tony Stilano"" an Italo-Australian Fish 'n Chip shop owner in his thirties to be first-class, his acting was very genuine and convincing, through his performance he managed to really bring to the surface the essence, or I should say the soul of the Italian Australian stereotype, which in reality is not too Italian but not too Australian either, Colosimo found that balance, breathed into its lungs and gave it life.<br /><br />The Cinematography could have been better, more shots of the local area would've been nice, from what I can see it was in Melbourne, but where in Melbourne? to me it looks like somewhere between Ivanhoe to Bullen, though I am not 100% sure on that one.<br /><br />I don't know why so many people are comparing this film to ""The Castle"" though they have similar themes running through them, Take Away stands in a league of its own.<br /><br />I think the film was Excellent with a capital ""E"" it has everything, it's funny, the jokes are great, it deals with contemporary issues facing Australian society, the story holds well, I loved it!

The only minor criticism mentioned is the cinematography, with the reviewer wishing for more shots of the local area.

The exteriors, both in Europe and Israel, seem very authentic, and the 4-hour miniseries length was just right for the telling of this story.

18530,"Like those who listened to radio reports about the attack on Pearl Harbor, every one who has ever seen PINK FLAMINGOS can tell you exactly where they were when they first saw it--and some thirty years later the movie is still one of the most unspeakably vile, obnoxious, repulsive, and hilariously funny films ever put to celluloid, guaranteed to test the strongest stomachs and the toughest funny bones.<br /><br />Filmed with a close-to-zero budget and some of the shakiest cinematography around, PINK FLAMINGOS tells the story of two families that compete for the tabloid title of ""The Filthiest People Alive."" Just how filthy can they be? Plenty: the film includes everything from sex with chickens to what I can only describe as a remarkable display of rectal control to a heaping helping of doggie doo, and I guarantee that you won't want to eat an egg for at least several weeks after seeing it.<br /><br />The cast is either wonderful, atrocious, or atrociously wonderful, depending on how you look at it. The star, of course, is Divine... and to describe Divine as the BIGGEST drag queen on the planet would the understatement of the year. She is a mammoth creature given to BIG eye makeup, BIG orange hair, and BIG expressions--she is the Charleton Heston of drag, and whether she is almost running down a jogger, pausing to use the bathroom on some one's front lawn, or startling real-life shoppers by taking a stroll along a Baltimore sidewalk she is both unspeakable and unspeakably funny. Others in the cast include Mary Vivian Pearce, Danny Mills, and the ever-appalling Edith Massey as members of Divine's family; and Mink Stole and David Lochary as the white-slaving, baby-selling couple who challenge Divine's status.<br /><br />It should be pretty obvious that PINK FLAMINGOS is not exactly a movie that will appeal to just every one, and viewers who know director John Waters only through such later films as HAIRSPRAY and CRYBABY will be in for a major jolt. But if you want to see something so completely different that even Monty Python couldn't imagine it, this is the movie for you. Just make sure you eat before you see it, because you probably won't want to eat afterward--and you might want to keep a barf bag handy just in case.<br /><br />Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review of John Waters' film ""Pink Flamingos"" is overwhelmingly positive, despite (or because of) its graphic and provocative content. The reviewer describes the film as ""unspeakably vile, obnoxious, repulsive, and hilariously funny,"" indicating a deep appreciation for its transgressive humor and willingness to push boundaries. The film's low-budget, DIY aesthetic is seen as a strength, adding to its raw, unapologetic energy. The cast, particularly Divine, is praised for their over-the-top performances, which add to the film's outrageous humor.

The reviewer acknowledges that ""Pink Flamingos"" is not for everyone, but for those who appreciate its brand of transgressive humor, it is a must-see. The review is written in a playful, tongue-in-cheek style, mirroring the film's irreverent tone.

18531,"My 10/10 rating of course applies only if you're willing to get completely and utterly grossed out*. Because you know that only John Waters can do that. In ""Pink Flamingos"" (his directorial debut), he portrays two families locked in combat to see who can be the filthiest person alive. What Divine famously does at the end pretty much answers the question. But even aside from that, the movie is basically an excuse to shock people beyond what anyone would usually imagine.

Even some of the lines are rather mind-blowing.<br /><br />*Otherwise, avoid this movie like you would the ebola virus!",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is a mixed bag, but ultimately, it leans towards a positive assessment of the film.

However, the reviewer seems to appreciate John Waters' bold and unapologetic approach to filmmaking, suggesting that the film's outrageousness is a deliberate choice rather than a mistake.

The reviewer's tone is playful and tongue-in-cheek, using hyperbolic language to emphasize the film's transgressive nature. The use of phrases like ""get completely and utterly grossed out"" and ""avoid this movie like you would the ebola virus"" is meant to be humorous and ironic, rather than genuinely cautionary.

18532,"A very strange, disturbing but intriguing film. I don't think I ever needed to see what a human being can do with his butt, and I doubt if I'll ever want to see it again. That said, there is much to be amused by, like Divine's take on Jayne Mansfield's classic walk in ""The Girl Can't Help It"" and putting slabs of meat between her legs in a grocery store. A gritty feel very much like a Russ Meyer film. Generally poor acting, with the notable exception of Divine.",Positive,"Mixed, but overall: positive",Positive,positive,"This review is a mixed assessment of the film, with both positive and negative comments.

On the positive side, the reviewer acknowledges that the film is ""intriguing"" and that there are moments of amusement, such as Divine's parody of Jayne Mansfield's walk and a memorable scene in a grocery store. The comparison to Russ Meyer's films suggests that the reviewer appreciates the film's gritty, exploitative aesthetic.

18533,"What's there to say about ""Pink Flamingos""? It is beyond criticism or even explanation because it doesn't really aspire to be like any other movie you've seen. You will either get it, or you won't, laugh at it or roll your eyes in disgust (or both). John Waters is an odd filmmaker (putting that mildly), mixing both innocent, childlike humor with shockingly offensive moments intended to...well, who knows what his intentions were. It is like a form of assault, albeit a funny one.<br /><br />The thing that makes Waters's humor so infectious and effective is that his characters inhabit a world that can seem both alien and completely familiar to the viewer, like the petty rivalries that form the plot of ""Pink Flamingos"". Surely everyone has experienced this kind of thing at some point, but almost certainly the matter at stake was not the title of ""The Filthiest Person Alive."" What makes the movie compelling viewing for me is the way that Waters creates giddy, self-contained environments and doesn't let you in on the joke right away. The people in his films are completely in tune with one another. For instance, when Cotton tells Babs that she doesn't want to accompany her into town because Crackers is bringing his ""lady friend"" out to the trailer, Babs reacts with a knowing smirk and says to her, in a conspiratorial aside, ""That little shed's just PERFECT..."" At this point, we do not know yet that Crackers plans to take his ""lady friend"" out to the shed to thrust live chickens at her naked body while Cotton watches orgasmically through a window, but this weirdness is totally commonplace and understood by the characters in the fictitiously degenerate world that Waters creates.<br /><br />Another example would be the conversations between the girls in the basement and Channing, the Marbles' deviant butler. The first time we see them, Waters cuts jarringly from a scene in Connie's cozy office to Channing descending into the basement, where we see that there are two women down there, one dead and one very much alive and p***ed off. Susan is not a cowering victim, but is enraged and abusive to Channing, leaping up to launch a full-scale verbal attack on her jailer. They both have a weird understanding of the bizarre situation, and she is not so much intimidated by her kidnapping as she is violently insulted and righteously furious. She does not let up for one second while Channing is in her sight, and the two scenes that feature their delirious banter are two of the comic highlights of the film. Later in the film, when Divine and Crackers break into the Marbles's home and discover their crimes of keeping abducted women in their basement, it represents the total lack of support that Divine and her family have for the brand of depravity that the Marbles are pandering--here is something Divine is unfamiliar with, a corruption devised by her newfound rivals, and she despises it. Furthermore, while kidnapping does not seem like something Divine would think twice about, she is indignant that the girls are being held down there and happily sets them free, relishing the revenge that they take on Channing.<br /><br />At the other end of the filth spectrum, Waters occasionally reminds us of the line between his twisted fantasy world and the ""real"" world. The first time we see Connie, she is belittling a minor character named Sandy Sandstone, who has never heard of Divine. Cookie, on the other hand, reacts with a hilariously matter-of-fact evaluation of Divine's title as the ""filthiest person alive"", revealing that she inhabits this world of unspoken and understood lunacy as well.<br /><br />Something also must be said for the way the players are in touch with their respective roles, especially Divine, who doesn't miss a note. Not once does he falter in the ridiculous garb and character he's been given, and it takes ""Pink Flamingos"" to a new level or weirdness. People actually believed Divine was like this in real life, and it's easy to understand why, because while watching the movie, you're not really thinking about the movie, you're thinking about these people who made it. Since they're really doing the outrageous things in the script, you start to think that maybe this is not a story but a bizarre documentary.<br /><br />But even more so, ""Pink Flamingos"" is not so much a movie as it is an event, or something that happens to you. Even though its shock value is mostly gone for me now (I say mostly because the a**hole scene and the chicken scene still make me wince), I still find this film to be hilarious and habit-forming.",Positive,positive,positive,positive,"This review of ""Pink Flamingos"" is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer praising John Waters' unique filmmaking style, which blends innocent humor with shockingly offensive moments. The reviewer notes that the film is beyond criticism or explanation, as it defies conventional norms and expectations. The film's ability to create a sense of familiarity and alienation simultaneously is highlighted, as well as its infectious humor and self-contained environments.

The reviewer also praises the performances of the cast, particularly Divine, who embodies the character of Babs Johnson with conviction and flair. The review highlights the film's ability to blur the lines between reality and fantasy, making it difficult to distinguish between the actors' performances and their real-life personas.

The reviewer's enthusiasm for the film is evident throughout the review, with phrases such as ""hilarious and habit-forming"" and ""compelling viewing."" The review concludes by stating that ""Pink Flamingos"" is not just a movie, but an event that happens to the viewer, implying a level of immersion and impact that is hard to shake off.

18534,"Babs Johnson (Divine) lives in a trailer with her son Crackers, her daughter Cotton and her mother Edie (Edie Massey). She's in competition with a couple named Connie and Raymond Marbles (Mink Stole, David Lochary) to be named the filthiest person alive. The film shows their attempts to outdo each other.<br /><br />This film is very much NOT for everyone. It's a in your face no holds barred assault in bad taste. Crackers has sex with a woman with a live chicken between them while his sister watches; the Marbles pick up female hitchhikers, impregnate them, keep them chained in the basement and sell the babies to lesbian couples; Divine and family have a party which includes cannibalism etc etc. It's disgusting but, in a way, not unwatchable. It's SO over the top and is so unapologetic about it that it's kind of fascinating. As director John Waters might say, it's bad taste done well. Also it's kind of amusing to watch--the acting is so wretched (especially by Massey) that you just watch it in disbelief. A friend laughed out loud at how bad Massey was (she improved in later pictures).<br /><br />This is NOT for people who are easily offended. Even though it's over 30 years old it's STILL shocking.

The reason for the 10 rating I'm going to give it is due to the fact, well, how could you rate this film? I always rate, so I just figure what the heck?

However, despite their revulsion, the reviewer acknowledges the film's originality and the audacity of its creator, John Waters. They seem to admire the fact that Waters was able to conceive of such a transgressive and provocative film, even if they don't necessarily enjoy the experience of watching it.

18536,"I grew up in Baltimore, so I was exposed to the films of John Waters, since I was way too young to watch them.

18538,"More entertaining than all the gay orgies in ""300"" combined. More heartbreaking than a Shakespearian tragedy. More poetic than even the most melodramatic poems about lost love and blah blah blah. And on top of all that, the greatest trash ever made.<br /><br />A black comedy testing the limits of the human senses, John Waters's cult movie ""Pink Flamingos"" is a story about the conflict between two families that ends in humiliation, death and of course the eating of dog feces (yeah by the way that is not actually the humiliating part). No no, this is not about the impossible love, there are no Romeos or Juliets on these 90 or so minutes. This movie is about the battle for prestige if you could call it that. The battle for the title - Filthiest person alive.<br /><br />On one side we have Divine (played by the cross-dressing Waters regular... umm... Divine) a caring daughter, good mother, cannibal, murderer, pervert and current owner of said title. She loves her son Crackers a bit way too much. Crackers himself sports a sexual attraction to both chickens and young ladies sometimes mixing them up in threesomes. Family friend and loyal accomplice Cotton gets her satisfaction from watching Crackers during some of his... acts involving the mentioned earlier objects of attraction. Last but not least Divine's mother and grandmother to Crackers, Edie. A 400 hundred pound woman, sleeping, eating and basically living in a baby cradle. She is addicted to eggs and loves the egg-man (the man who brings the eggs...lol).<br /><br />The four of them live peacefully in a caravan outside the city until the moment when they become a target for the Marbles.

Has anyone ever cared to stop and think about the ambition and dedication Mr.Waters possesses. To gather your best friends up and to create a movie just to gross out thousands of viewers all over shows this man has a great deal of ambition inside himself. Just read his biography Shock Value.

18547,"I was first introduced to John Waters films by seeing ""Female trouble"" on IFC. I was disgusted but for some sick reason i enjoyed it. Then, i picked up the Pink Flamingos DVD in the John Waters Boxed Set. The movie is about Babs Johnson ""The Filthiest Person Alive"" who lives in a trailer in Maryland with her obese egg obsessed mother,and her deranged son ""Crackers"". In the movie you will see such sick sights as sex with chickens, drag-queens, people eating feces, torture, and all other sorts of random humiliation.

18548,"""Pink Flamingos"" was revolutionary for its time, and even today it's still hard to watch. Not that I didn't enjoy the film, it's hilarious; but it's very repulsive and Jonh Waters pushes the envelope as far as it can go. The story concerns Babs Johnson (Devine), she's the filthiest women alive. She lives in a trailer with her son Crackers and daughter Cotton. Not to mention the overweight Edie who's obsessed with eggs and sleeps in a crib. Then there's Connie and Raymond Marble, two filthy perverts who are jealous of Babs. They long to outdo her in being the filthiest person alive. This means having their janitor impregnate kidnapped women and selling the babies to lesbian couples, flashing people in public, and even sending Babs a turd in the mail. Babs fights back to prove she's the most deranged person alive. Which even includes incest, murder and eating dog crap and other sick sexual acts. It's a film that's fun for the whole family.

18551,"Pink Flamingos: A Representation of Society's Past<br /><br />Pink Flamingos, a film directed by John Waters in 1972, is a very disturbing portrayal of the negative impact a traumatized childhood can have on future life. Babs Johnson grew up in a very non-typical home. Blatantly, you can see the impact this had on society through her actions up to the ending where she engulfs dog feces. Was this film just some sick and twisted perversion of endless gut-wrenching occurrences, or was it symbolic of something much deeper? To side with the first would be the easy way out and to the side with the latter might seem demented, but possibly true. The film does have some credible resemblance to actual events of our societal past. Every leader that we as people view as `horrible' displays similar characteristics to those of Babs Johnson. Ivan the Terrible, Genghis Khan, Adolph Hitler, and Joseph Staling all had `troubling' childhoods. Babs Johnson had a troubling childhood and therefore is associated in the same class as all of the previous mentioned rulers. That is why a great deal of her actions throughout the film can be seen as disturbing. However, were her actions her own fault or society's for letting her grow up the way she did. Furthermore, each character in this film represents either a past leader or event. Another coincidence is Edith's obsession with eggs. With an open mind this can be tied into the genocide and Hitler's attempt to annihilate the Jews. Some view Hitler as a genius, others a mad man. John Waters must have seen him as a mad man because his representation Edith was indeed mentally ill. Edith's son Crackers and traveling companion Cotton are symbolic of what was wrong in our own backyard, slavery. Both names, are slang terms that represent a time period that most of us would rather forget. Theses characters are crucial in terms that it points out that in some times, our society in America was no better than what we often view as horrendous acts of social onslaught in other cultures. The chicken f**king scene is the epitome of what was wrong in our society in this time period and is still wrong. Chicken, is a 1970's slang term for woman. Therefore it might be possible that John Waters were trying to bring out the subject of rape through Cotton and Crackers actions. The antagonist family, if a single antagonist can be determined in this film, was the Marble's. Marble is often mentioned in association with wealth. Therefore this may be symbolic of the struggle between the poor and the wealthy a fight that still continues on today and will probably continue on forever. Pink Flamingos is a monumental film for its disturbing scenes but should also be noted for its camouflaged political agenda that Waters displayed so affluently throughout its entirety.",Positive,Positive,Positive,positive,"This review of John Waters' 1972 film ""Pink Flamingos"" presents a thought-provoking analysis of the film's themes and symbolism. The reviewer argues that the film is not just a collection of disturbing and shocking scenes, but rather a commentary on the impact of a troubled childhood on an individual's life and its resemblance to the characteristics of infamous historical leaders. The reviewer draws parallels between the film's characters and real-life events, such as the obsession with eggs and its connection to the Holocaust, and the representation of slavery through the characters of Crackers and Cotton. The reviewer also interprets the film's notorious ""chicken f**king"" scene as a commentary on rape and the objectification of women.

18559,"Spoiler Alert I worked as an extra on this Lifetime TV movie (filmed in Seattle). It's really interesting when you take part in the production of a movie, because usually, they are still in the process of either still writing parts (as was the case here) or making editing cuts and major changes from the final parts.<br /><br />My husband and I both worked as extras in this movie, and I recall them discussing on the set how it was yet to be determined whether or not the little girl dies in the end.

Just something to think about.<br /><br />By the way, I play a police detective you can see for a split second and my husband plays another detective you can see quite often (we've counted four times).

18560,"""Hit and Run"" is a shattering story starring the always wonderful Margaret Colin as a society lady who ""has it all"" until she hits a child with her car and leaves the scene. Hence the title. The tragedy is that she goes to call for help and returns, but is frightened away by angry passers-by who think the hitter abandoned the scene. This was made in the days when not everyone had a cell phone or there wouldn't be a story.<br /><br />Colin's guilt and anguish are palpable and cause her to act so strangely that a detective gets onto her right away. Her lies sink her deeper and deeper into a self-loathing hole, causing her to make a bad situation worse.<br /><br />This is a very thought-provoking story, and one can't help but to feel this lady's pain, wishing throughout that she would simply come clean.<br /><br />As a TV movie, thanks to Colin and a strong script, this is a well above average TV movie.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the TV movie ""Hit and Run"" for its thought-provoking storyline, strong script, and outstanding performance by Margaret Colin.

18562,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is about true love and friendship. About turning your life around and doing something good for someone else. Thomas Bo Larsen may play the same role he has done in so many other movies, but recently we have seen him in other roles which he does great too. But so what if he plays the same role that he has done in other movies  he's perfect for that role. Ulrich Thomsen does a great job too. These two criminal ""low-lifes"" are the best friends ever. They share everything and they do everything for each other no matter what the costs are. When they find out that Peter's daughter is being abused they put everything on hold (things you can't put on hold unless you have to make even more criminal acts) and takes her to a better place. They do the best they can  these two men are not masterminds but they have their heart in the right place.

18563,"This must be one of the funniest Danish movies ever made. Ulrich Thomsen and Thomas Bo Larsen are hilarious, as they drive across Sweden. I don't know how Ulrich Thomsen does it, but somehow he can manage to play insane in a very sane way.

The only caveat mentioned is that the film may not be suitable for non-Danish speakers, as the reviewer believes that subtitles would not be effective in conveying the humor.

18565,"In a style reminiscent of the best of David Lean, this romantic love story sweeps across the screen with epic proportions equal to the vast desert regions against which it is set. It's a film which purports that one does not choose love, but rather that it's love that does the choosing, regardless of who, where or when; and furthermore, that it's a matter of the heart often contingent upon prevailing conditions and circumstances. And thus is the situation in `The English Patient,' directed by Anthony Minghella, the story of two people who discover passion and true love in the most inopportune of places and times, proving that when it is predestined, love will find a way.<br /><br />It's WWII; flying above the African desert, Hungarian Count Laszlo de Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) is shot down, his biplane mistaken for an enemy aircraft. And though he survives the crash, he is severely burned. To his great good fortune, however, he is rescued by a tribe of nomads and winds up in a hospital. But existing conditions are governed by circumstances of war, and Almasy soon becomes one of many patients being transported via convoy to a different facility. Upon reaching Italy, he is too weak and ill to continue on, and a Canadian nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche), volunteers to stay behind with him at an abandoned monastery.<br /><br />Hana soon discovers that her charge is something of a man of mystery, as Almasy remembers nothing of his past, and not even his own name. Thought to be English, the only clues pointing to who he is are contained in a book found in his possession after the crash, but even they are as cryptic as Hana's patient. Slowly, however, under prompting from Hana, Almasy begins to remember bits and pieces of his life, and his story begins to unfold. And his memory is helped along even more by the appearance of a mysterious stranger named Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who suspects that Almasy is the man he's been looking for-- a man with whom he wants to settle a score. But, burned beyond recognition, Almasy may or may not be that man. Meanwhile, Almasy's memories continue to surface; memories of a woman he loved, Katherine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas)-- as well as memories of Katherine's husband, Geoffrey (Colin Firth). And, crippled in mind and body as he is, those memories become the only thing left to which he can cling with any hope at all, even as his life seems to be slipping farther away with each passing moment.<br /><br />In addition to directing, Anthony Minghella also wrote the screenplay for this film, which he adapted from the novel by Michael Ondaatje. The result is an epic saga presented in the tradition of Lean's `Doctor Zhivago' and `Lawrence of Arabia'; a magnificent film that fills the screen and the senses with unprecedented grandeur and beauty. Simply put, Minghella's film is genius realized; crafted and delivered with a poetic perfection, watching it is like watching a Monet come to life. From the opening frames, Minghella casts a hypnotic spell over his audience that is binding and transporting, with a story that has an emotional beauty that equals the engagingly stunning and vibrant images brought to life by John Seale's remarkable cinematography; images that virtually fill the screen as well as the soul of the viewer. In every sense, this is a film of rare eloquence, with a striking emotional capacity that facilitates an experience that is truly transcendental. Nominated in twelve categories, it deservedly received a total of nine Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actress (Binoche) and Cinematography.<br /><br />If one had to choose a single word to describe the `essence' of this film, it would be `excellence.' Even an extraordinary film, however, does not receive nine Oscars without performances that are extraordinary in kind; and the performances given by Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas here transcend the term `Oscar worthy.' Nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of Almasy (Geoffrey Rush was awarded the gold for `Shine'), Fiennes has never been better, achieving an emotional depth with his character that is nearly palpable. Private and introspective, Almasy is not by his very nature an individual to whom the audience will be able to form an intimate connection; Fiennes, however, finds a way to open that emotional door just enough to let you in, enough so that you taste the honest passion welling up within him. And it works. Almasy does not seek your friendship; he will, however, gain your compassion.<br /><br />Kristen Scott Thomas, too, received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress (Frances McDormand received the award for `Fargo') for her portrayal of Katherine, a woman whose stoic countenance masks the emotional conflict raging within her, born of the forbidden passion that enslaves her and yet to which she gives herself willingly, casting off her shackles of repression to embrace a love so strong it threatens to consume her. The reserve Katherine must maintain evokes the empathy of the audience, as Scott Thomas successfully mines the emotional depths of her character to the greatest possible effect. It's the kind of performance that draws you in and holds you fast, taking you as it does beyond that curtain of hypocrisy that dictates what must be if only for the sake of appearances, and allows you to experience a true sense of unbridled passion. Understated and shaded with subtlety, it's terrific work by Kristin Scott Thomas.<br /><br />Binoche gives a stunning, affecting performance, as well, as the kindhearted nurse, Hana; it is her humanity, in fact, which defines love in it's purest sense and offers a balanced perspective of it within the context of the film. Her relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews) affords us a glimpse of passion of another kind, which contrasts effectively with the intensity of that between Almasy and Katherine. `The English Patient' is a film that will move you and fill you emotionally; one you will not want to see end. 10/10. <br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is a glowing tribute to Anthony Minghella's film ""The English Patient"", praising its epic proportions, poetic perfection, and emotional beauty.

This vibrant young woman has a heart of gold, kissing wounded soldiers, but she thinks that she is a curse as anybody she ever loved tends to die on her...<br /><br />Colin Firth is good as Katherine's husband... He is a British spy flying into the tough desert in a yellow biplane to take aerial maps of the whole North African continent... He quickly becomes friend of the Count, yet when he realizes that his wife has committed adultery, his face reflected a peaceful fury...<br /><br />William Dafoe plays a double-agent spy who covers his anger with a strange charm... He is a crippled war veteran who has a hidden agenda... This cunning Canadian man seems to know of some dark secret in Almasy's past... He believes the 'English patient' is partially responsible for the mutilation of his hands, and is busy seeking revenge on everyone even remotely involved...<br /><br />Naveen Andrews is Hana's ardent lover He is a handsome Sikh, and an explosives expert with a dangerous job There's a scene that is stuck in my head because it literally had me on the edge of my seat for what seemed an eternity In this particular scene, the military sapper has to cut the wires on a bomb that has been hidden on a bridge It's on a timer and he only has a few minutes left The scene cuts back and forth between his tense face, the wires and his dirty fingers as they try madly to figure out how to untangle and cut the wires without detonating the bomb <br /><br />All the conventional elements of the genre are at peaks of excellence in ""The English Patient."" John Seale's cinematography is breathtaking, and Gabriel Yared's majestic music is dreamy, and romantic This is a rich motion picture with ambition and style, a fever dream, lyrical and complex We are almost able to feel the heat of the desert, the pain of the burnings, the intimate flush of humanity that becomes the most haunting element of this epic love story...",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is a glowing tribute to the film ""The English Patient,"" praising its epic romance, stunning cinematography, and outstanding performances from the cast.

18568,"as can be read in many reviews here it is a movie you love or hate - apparently not so much space for opinions in between. I for one think that is a good sign. <br /><br />I always appreciated this movie, although the genre is not my typical style (I never watched Titanic for instance, and am not planning to).<br /><br />The English Patient grips because it shows how people can be different when they are in an exotic environment as opposed when they are 'home' (Katherine), it shows how destructive love can be in a slow, strong and utterly painful way, it excites because of the extremely passionate affair, the pain of the one(s) who leave behind, how pointless one can feel to move on. <br /><br />The photography is just stunning, not to mention the play of the actors. The pace is slow, but timely, and that does justice to the book, the timeline, and the depth/development of the characters. To put this in 110 minutes (as some seem to suggest here) would amputate the multi-layeredness of this movie.

In the course of his care, the Count starts to tell Hana of his recent past. It seems he worked in a government capacity in Africa, where he met a beautiful married lady named Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas). Although they tried to avoid each other, they fell in love. After a brief affair, Katherine called it quits, leaving the Count desolate. Even so, the two would meet again, under heart-wrenching circumstances. Meanwhile, Hana herself falls for a Sihk man in the British bomb squad. Yet, the war is raging relentlessly. Can love exist when the world is in turmoil? This is a tremendous film, based on an equally fine but complex novel. The plot has many story lines that are woven together beautifully, each of them poignant beyond description. The script itself is elegant and contains many memorable lines. Fiennes is magnificent, both as the burn victim and as the man who thought love was a myth.

18572,"'The English Patient' can rightly be compared to the films of David Lean, whose sweeping epics such as 'Lawrence of Arabia' and 'Bridge on the River Kwai' must have inspired the director Anthony Minghella. The film is beautifully photographed, and like 'Lawrence', is set in Northern Africa, but during the second world war. The story is complex, but it boils down to a forbidden love between an opinionated and often difficult archeologist played by Ralph Fiennes and a married woman played by Kristin Scott Thomas.<br /><br /> The story, based on a novel by Michael Ondaatje, is told in flashbacks by Fiennes' Count Laszlo de Almasy - the titular character. The fact that his name does not sound like he's English plays a key role in what unfolds. He has been badly burned in a plane crash, occurring just as the film opens, and is being cared for back in Europe by Hana, an army nurse played by Juliette Binoche. What makes this story epic is the vast sweep across place and time, and the development of characters beyond that of the two ill-fated lovers. The film makes clear that true love and passion, even with dreaded consequences, can make life worth living, or worth dying for. If you're a romantic at heart, and can appreciate a film without the standard happy endings and simple moral codes, you may find that 'The English Patient' speaks directly to you.<br /><br />",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, drawing comparisons to the epic films of David Lean and praising the cinematography, complex storytelling, and character development in ""The English Patient"".

18573,"It is a strangely powerful and moving experience to see ""The English Patient"" again after Anthony Minghella's death. Most of his body of work is dedicated to one shattering point. The endless moral struggle of those who, consciously, walk a very thin line. In ""The Talented Mr Ripley"" Minghella moves away from Patricia Highsmith's amoral Tom Ripley to give the murderer a conscience. In ""Breaking And Entering"" Minghella gives Jude Law's character the need to confess and the rewards are chillingly moving. Here, in ""The English Patient"", the characters in love are never too far away from their corroding feeling of guilt. Ralph Finnes and Kristin Scott Thomas are extraordinary. They strip their characters from every pretense in a compelling complicity with us, the audience. Juliette Binoche is, quite simply, spectacular and her scenes with the wonderful Naveen Andrews are filled with a ""Minghellian"" sensual innocence. Anthony Minghella gave us films that were,one way or another, that elusive mix of art and commerce. He was true to himself but thought about his audience.

After the war, in the mine-ridden hills of Italy, a kind nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche), who has apparently lost everybody close to her, remains in a ruined monastery to look after the dying man. Over time, she comes to learn more and more about her ""English patient,"" who is actually revealed to be a Hungarian geographer, Count Laszlo de Almásy. Rather than losing his memory in the plane crash, we learn that this scar-ridden man has perhaps chosen to forget his past, both to protect himself from persecution and to cure himself of the tragic memories of his past love. Via numerous flashbacks, we learn of Almásy's former exploits in the Sahara desert, and his romantic liaison with a married woman, Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas).<br /><br />It's certainly easy to see why 'The English Patient' was so successful at the Oscars. It is such a beautiful film, blending the quiet beauty of the Italian countryside with the endless golden sands of the desert. Cinematographer John Seale captures the landscape to perfection; not since David Lean's magnificent 'Lawrence of Arabia' has a film shown the desert with such beauty and grandeur, making particularly good use of sweeping aerial shots from Almásy's plane. Even in the film's more intimate moments, excellent use of close-ups and lighting capture the emotion of the scene, coupled, of course, with the brilliant performances from all the cast members.<br /><br />A long-time favourite actor of mine, 'The English Patient' might just contain Ralph Fiennes' finest performance, and, considering his history includes such films as 'Schindler's List' and 'The Constant Gardener,' this is not a complement that is to be taken lightly. His Count Laszlo de Almásy is initially a very sympathetic character, but, as we slowly learn more about his past, his likable qualities are eroded by his less-admirable tendencies towards others. ""Ownership"" is a major theme of the film. When asked by Katherine what he hates most, Almásy replies with ""Ownership. Being owned. When you leave you should forget me."" However, as the relationship progresses, and Katherine perhaps tries to distance herself from him, Almásy reveals a hint of arrogance, insisting that his love for her somehow entitles him to have her whenever he likes: ""I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine, which belong to me.""<br /><br />Juliette Binoche, who received an Oscar for her performance here, is excellent as Hana, the lonesome nurse who fears to love because of the tragedies that have always harmed those close to her. After some time of caring for Almásy alone, she is joined by a dubious Canadian thief, David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who lost his thumbs during the war, and who suspects that it was Almásy who betrayed him to the Germans. Hana also strikes up a tentative romantic relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews), an Indian bomb-diffuser in the British Army. However, due to her past history, Hana is afraid that becoming involved with Kip will doom him to death, particularly considering his very dangerous line of work.<br /><br />At 160 minutes in length, 'The English Patient' wonderfully evokes memories of the classic romantic epics of old, successfully finding a balance of mystery, love, joy and tragedy. The ending of the film is heartbreaking and sorrowful, but also uplifting in its own way. Whilst some romantic relationships are doomed from the very beginning, others have a very good chance of bringing happiness. Nevertheless, in every case, it is always better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, praising ""The English Patient"" as a grand, intimate, and heartbreakingly beautiful film that evokes the golden years of Hollywood.

18575,"I won't go to a generalization, and say it's the best love story of all time, as some have said. That's fine, people feel very deeply about this film, you either love it I believe...or you simply hate it. I don't want to say, the best of all,because that is simply too 'broad' for me to make a statement like that. However, I feel very passionately about The English Patient, as well as millions of other people do. <br /><br />The awards say it all. <br /><br />I don't agree with critics, on many levels, however, the ones that picked this one, I couldn't agree more.<br /><br />9-Oscars. <br /><br />41-wins.<br /><br />37-other nominations, makes this love story,on the top of the bunch. <br /><br />From the director, Anthony Minghella, the story that bursts onto the screen and as Mr. Peterman (from T.V.s Seinfeld) said, ""Elaine, I simply can't take my eyes off of it!"" In this instance, I don't agree with Elaine's response. But the story builds and takes the right time, needed to make it's case beautifully. The cinematography,(John Seale) won multiple awards as well, as it ought too. I have not really paid much attention to Juliette Binoche, until now. Well, not entirely true I loved her performance in ""Sabrina"" Lovely story of a somewhat complicated relationship, next to Harrison Ford. But this was simply an incredibly differing character for her, and as deeply talented as she is, she simply shined in her own subtle and graceful way, she was just what this film was looking for, I'm truly glad that it was her performance and not another actress.

18576,"I watched this movie when it was released and being really young and not too much into cinema it was one of the most fascinating cinematic experiences I ever had and it really left a mark inside me.At first I didn't quite understand the story and probably failed to make the necessary correlations between past and present as the movie presents them to the viewer.<br /><br />Years after I first watched I managed to watch it again and this was the time that I fell in love with 'The English Patient', it touched me so deeply and for me it became the best film ever made.<br /><br />Anthony Minghella made an absolutely stunning film, all the locations are amazing and through his camera he manages to create unbelievable emotions inside you.<br /><br />Of course, the music of the film is such a big part of the whole emotional journey of the characters and the film would not be the same without it.<br /><br />But personally the best thing was the fragile performance that Ralph Fiennes gave in this masterpiece.

18577,"One of the most charming and, for me at least, the most powerful elements of Anthony Minghella's enthralling Best Picture-winner ""The English Patient"" is that, in the mid 90s, when Hollywood was in the initial stage of having lost its nerve for grand new projects, a film was created that brought back tracesvery powerful tracesof the sweeping, wonderful majesty that crafted movies such as ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) and ""The Ten Commandments"" (1956). ""The English Patient"" contains very much of what made those films so powerful. It has that glorious feeling, a stretched running time that hardly seems long at all, and fascinating characters with pasts and stories.<br /><br />""The English Patient"", based on a novel by the same name by Michael Ondaatje, is like ""The Godfather: Part II"" (1974) in the sense of how it's constructed. It's a blending of two stories: the past and the present and it all revolves around the titular character: an English patient in the post years of World War Two. Ralph Fiennes plays the English patient, who has been scarred for life by a plane crash, and being taken care of in an isolated church by a single nurse played marvelously by Juliette Binoche. Apart from bonding with her raspy-voiced, troubled patient, Binoche comes to learn about his past when a stranger (Willem Dafoe) arrives and the two men appear to know each other.<br /><br />That's just one of the two beautifully crafted stories that shape this film. The other one, told in flashback, is the patient's past, before he was scarred and dying in a bed. The story of the present mixed with the patient's past and his love affair that tragically changed his life forever.<br /><br />To be blunt, ""The English Patient"" is a love story blended with a sweeping epic sensation and it blends magnificently. What I really admired about the love story between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas was how passionate, how obsessive, how enchanting it was shown on screen. Usually in love stories, such as Minghella's later ""Cold Mountain"" (2003), the romantic elements seem far more lustful than obsessive to me. Some of the love scenes feature elements that may tend to be associated more with lust than love, but still, because it is so well developed and not rushed and not exploited out of proportion, we can believe that there is a sure, true love between these characters. It reminded me a lot of ""Vertigo"" (1958) in how well the filmmakers and performers convinced us that these were two actual human beings who truly fell in love with each other.<br /><br />Performances all around were great. I was especially enthralled by the performance by Juliette Binoche, who took home the Oscar for her performance the following year. I also liked Willem Dafoe playing the sort of cynical, questionable character that he's always quintessential at playing. And of course I can't leave out Fiennes and Scott Thomas and their portrayals of two very passionate lovers.<br /><br />Despite my enormous enthusiasm for this epic, I would be dishonest if I were to describe it as a perfect film. There are two flaws that I cannot glance over. Number one, it is a little too long and the reason for this is my second complaint, there are a few unnecessary subplots. I was not enchanted or particularly interested with the second love story between Binoche and a bomb specialist played by Naveen Andrews. My research has led me to assume that this plot element comes from the original book and I'm sure it worked perfectly in there, but in the film, it just seems a littledistracting and the relationship between the two characters didn't fascinate me. I was far more interested by Fiennes character and his relationships with his two leading actresses.<br /><br />Nevertheless, these two flaws are easily forgivable even if they do slow things down a bit. Those put aside, ""The English Patient"" is an extraordinary achievement of film-making. To me, it was sort of like an insane mix up between ""Casablanca"" (1942) and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962), two remarkable and better films, and this effective blend proved to be well worth my time. It is a real shame that Anthony Minghella has left us. For he was a truly gifted filmmaker. This is all the evidence anybody needs.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer praising ""The English Patient"" as a sweeping epic that brings back the grandeur of classic films like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""The Ten Commandments"". The reviewer appreciates the film's ability to balance two stories, one in the present and one in the past, and how they intertwine to create a powerful narrative. The performances of the cast, particularly Ralph Fiennes, Juliette Binoche, and Kristin Scott Thomas, are also highly praised for their convincing portrayals of complex characters.

The reviewer's enthusiasm for the film is evident in the use of superlatives such as ""enthralling"", ""powerful"", ""glorious"", and ""extraordinary achievement of filmmaking"". The review highlights the film's ability to craft a believable and passionate love story, reminiscent of ""Vertigo"", and praises the cinematography and direction for creating a sense of epic scope.

While the reviewer acknowledges two flaws, namely the film's length and some unnecessary subplots, these are considered minor complaints that do not detract from the overall impact of the film. The review concludes by praising the film as a masterpiece of filmmaking, comparing it favorably to classic films like ""Casablanca"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"".

18579,"I can never figure if this is the Artiest Soap Opera ever produced, or the Soapiest Art Movie. No matter, John Seale's cinematogaphy is utterly ravishing. Ondaatje's novel is not reduced, but for once, elevated to film. If there is a fault, it is in the original novel, not in Anthony Minghella's beautiful movie. Anyone who has a problem with it's length almost certainly has not read the book, and probably cannot read. I do not like repeating adjectives, but ravishing serves the purpose. <br /><br />Apart from the storyline, the players excel.

18580,"The book is better than the film mostly because of the writer Ondatje's prose. Before I saw this film, someone who had seen it, told me the love depicted in this film isn't real. After seeing this film, I can see how her suspension of disbelief in this regard could've been distracting to other movie-goers as well. Frankly, some of the intense displays of love were laughable and seem to be on the edge of parody. But by the end, everyone should realize this is a big message piece of art. It is not specifically about love at all, it uses ""love"" to dialectically reveal the human divide or the arbitrary borders of countries that help justify wars and hatred. It is about misunderstandings and the blind following of the things that supposedly separate us. The critical scene for the real theme of this movie is when the hero or antihero's pleas for help for his stranded lover in the desert is ignored and disregarded for the reasons shown in that scene. This film is also about hope and forgiveness, the hope epitomized in the interracial relationship between Binoche's recovering character and the Indian minesweeper (echoed in the Sikh's buddy-buddy relationship with his white coworker who ends up dying nonsensically) and the forgiveness epitomized in the Caravaggio character's first hunt and then forcing out of what he thinks will be the hero's confessions for his war ""crimes"" (betrayal of country). I think the film could've been made even better than it is. I don't know if a more realistic portrayal of the circumstances of love would've made the real themes and points of this film even more obvious or not, but I agree this film is not about realistic romantic love, as the people behind this piece of art or film imply in an early scene when the eventual lovers first meet. The hero talks about how a new car, broken-down car, fast car, etc. (I'm paraphrasing) is still just a car no matter what adjective you put in front of it. She replies but parental love, platonic love, romantic love, etc. are very different kinds of love. This is ironic because this film is really about the one love all humans should want which is the love of (or for) peace (not materialistic things which are usually the real reasons for wars, epitomized in something most of us want such as ""cars"", let's say). Otherwise, we may be left stranded to die in a cave in a vast desert with ancient wall art/drawings of swimmers, suggesting that the seas and life-supporting waters which were once there have all but disappeared. I believe ""The English Patient"" won the Oscar because of these big messages not specifically for its depiction of romantic love. Awards tend to go that way. The relationship of the hero and heroine was necessary to draw the audience in, unfortunately this view of love may be antiquated in the age of divorce and so many singles who can't seem to get together on so many levels, so ridiculous versions of mythic love are hard to get into, even in daydreams, which film love has always been, especially in good old Hollywood. The film may fall short of what people expect but a 7 out of 10 movie worth seeing, regardless.",Positive,Positive,Positive,positive,"This review is generally positive, but with some criticisms and nuanced observations. The reviewer acknowledges that the film adaptation may not live up to the book, particularly in its portrayal of love, which can come across as unrealistic or even laughable at times. However, they argue that the film's true themes lie beyond romantic love, focusing on the human divide, misunderstandings, and the arbitrary borders that lead to war and hatred. The reviewer praises the film's message, highlighting its exploration of hope, forgiveness, and the importance of striving for peace.

18581,"In World War II, a badly burned amnesiac known only as ""The English Patient"" is found in the African desert and is transported to Italy, where he joins a convoy of medical troops and others at an abandoned monastery. Among them are Hana (Juliette Binoche), a Canadian nurse whose lovers generally meet unpleasant ends; Kip (Naveen Andrews) and Hardy (Kevin Whately), two explosives experts who search the monastery for bombs; and David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), a Canadian soldier-of-fortune who knows the identity of the English patient and has a score to settle.<br /><br />Through flashbacks we learn the story of the Patient: he is Laszo Almasy (Ralph Fiennes), a Hungarian explorer who, in the late '30s, falls in with a group of British cartographers, including Geoffrey Clifton (Colin Firth) and his wife Katharine (Kristen Scott-Thomas), while mapping the deserts of North Africa. After Clifton leaves them on government business, Katharine and Clifton fall in love with each other in the desert, resulting in an affair that, naturally, has a less-than-happy ending.<br /><br />If one is able to overlook the illogical parts of the story line (such as, why would a patient found in Africa be sent to what is essentially the front line of the war in Italy?), then you can appreciate ""The English Patient"" as a throwback to the intelligent, layered, sweeping epics of David Lean in the '60s. Much more than ""Titanic"" or other epic romances of late, this movie puts one in mind of ""Doctor Zhivago"" and ""Gone With the Wind"" - an epic love story set against a huge historical backdrop. You shouldn't expect a war film, though there are some striking (if all-too-brief) scenes of violence that stand out more than the romantic sections, as is usually the case (Caravaggio's interrogation by a sadistic SS officer (Jurgen Prochnow) in particular).<br /><br />The movie is very ambiguous, in regards to pretty much everything. The central question of the film is: How far are you willing to go for love? As critics of the movie are fast to point out, Almasy is, on the surface, a far-from-likable character - he has an affair with a married woman and betrays his country by giving maps and intelligence to the Germans, causing the death of his friend Madox (Julian Wadham) and the torture of Caravaggio, and actually killing a British soldier who has him under arrest at one point. The fact that Almasy is in many ways reprehensible is kind of the point - he's in love with Katharine, and sees the world narrowly in terms of his love that loyalty to country (or anything else for that matter) is secondary; as Almasy says, he hates ""Ownership. Being owned."" The two engage in a rather bold love affair (shagging within ear shot of hundreds of people at a Christmas party) and it's clear that Katharine is more drawn to the mysterious, exciting Almasy than the comparatively boring Geoffrey.<br /><br />The 1944 subplot is somewhat shaky and seems superfluous; the romance between Kip and Hannah is never completely believable, and I feel the film could have done without it. But those sequences do add an interesting texture of mystery and complexity to the film, so I won't complain too much.<br /><br />Like the epics mentioned above, the film is able to convey time and place through simple devices like crowd scenes, strategically placed posters, and military presence. We do not need to dwell on the fact that it's 1938 in Cairo, but it's helpful to know. The direction of Anthony Minghella and the desert cinematography by John Seale are absolutely gorgeous; the sand dunes, sand storms, and haunting caves of the desert are captured in beautiful detail. Gabriel Yared's score is haunting and atmospheric.<br /><br />The acting is generally solid. Fiennes gives a very layered performance as a character who is mysterious, complex, and haunted. The difference between the Almasys of 1938 and 1944 are remarkable; one exciting and somewhat carefree, the other haunted and reflective. Kirsten Scott Thomas is effective as Katharine, the female explorer looking for adventure, and Colin Firth gives one of his best performances as Geoffrey, who realizes early on that he's no competition for the exciting Almasy. Willem Dafoe does nice work as Caravaggio, the shifty, hunted thief-turned-spy driven by revenge. Jurgen Prochnow gives a performance reminiscent of Jose Ferrer in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (and a similar character too): very brief, but more memorable then some of the major characters. Some of the 1944 actors are unremarkable: Juliette Binochette is nothing special, while Naveen Andrews is good but unremarkable. Kevin Whately, as Kip's ill-fated partner, does what he can with a rather smallish role.<br /><br />""The English Patient"" is not a perfect movie by any means, but the vituperative attacks on it by much of the movie-going public are not deserved at all. Maybe it's a show of how film sensibilities have changed since the era of the Leans and Kubricks, or maybe people were expecting something simple to understand. Complex to fault, brilliantly directed and shot, ""The English Patient"" is a wonderful modern-day epic.<br /><br />8/10",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the film ""The English Patient"" for its epic scope, layered storytelling, and nuanced characterizations. The reviewer acknowledges some minor flaws, such as the somewhat shaky 1944 subplot and the unremarkable performances of some supporting actors.

The reviewer draws favorable comparisons to classic epics like ""Doctor Zhivago"" and ""Gone with the Wind,"" highlighting the film's ability to convey a sense of time and place through its setting and production design.

The reviewer also appreciates the film's complexity and moral ambiguity, particularly in its portrayal of the titular character, Laszlo Almasy, who is both flawed and sympathetic.

18582,"There have been several comments already on the site focusing on the ""prestige"" feel of the film - and there is a lot of heavy-weight talent on show: from Fiennes and Scott-Thomas to the magnificently rendered design and scoring, to the masterly direction. No wonder that Andrew Lloyd Webber's acceptance speech for ""Evita"" at that year's Oscars began ""Well, thank God that ""The English Patient"" had no songs in it."" Writing of Oscar winners takes me to Juliette Binoche, who, in a stellar cast, gives a beautiful performance. It is heartening to see that the dynamics which seem to influence the award for Best Actor (often going to showy pyrotechnic display) aren't at work in the female categories. Just as Emma Thompson's hugely well-deserved Oscar for her portrayal of Margaret Schlegel in ""Howard's End"" proved that one of the hardest things that an actor can do is make the portrayal of ""goodness"" involving, so Binoche's win proved that it could be that - and seriously sexy.

18585,"The English Patient is one of those films that mostly deserve all the highest praise. I say, most, because this movie, albeit very serious, intense, deep and really thoughtful, still suffers some drawbacks. First and foremost, why, oh why are the modern films so long? This one lasts for more than two hours and from time to time it becomes really hard to concentrate and follow the extremely serious plot. I say, if the film were an hour shorter, that would serve it only good. However, we have what we have. The winner of several Oscars, The English Patient is still very good. It is a deep, insightful treatise of human soul, love and betrayal, war and cowardice, violence and bravery. Ralph Fiennes is a smashing superb actor. His hero, neurotic and silent, is an enigmatic person, ready for everything only to save the life of his lover. He is great, even though half the time he is a deformed cripple. He is the strongest link here. Juliette Binoche is as usual very convincing and sweet. She adds a lot with her excellent play and the love story plot with that Sikh officer. Willem Defoe, Colin Firth, Christine Scott Thomas are all here, all enormous and all very strong. And then there is desert of Egypt, then there is deep, cloudless sky, green groves of Italy. The nature is here, even when people die, bombs roar, land mines explode. War is here, too. It is obvious, terrible, and bloody. Then, there are corpses, horrible gory bodies, then nude bodies, adultery and all. I do not know what to say. So much of a splendid actors' work, so much of realism, so much of brutality that war brings. This is not a film for relaxation. It makes you think.",Positive,Positive,Positive,positive,"This review of ""The English Patient"" is largely positive, praising the film's depth, intensity, and thought-provoking themes. The reviewer acknowledges that the film's length, exceeding two hours, can make it challenging to maintain focus, but this is a minor criticism. The reviewer's admiration for the film's exploration of human nature, love, betrayal, war, and bravery is evident. The performances of the cast, particularly Ralph Fiennes, Juliette Binoche, and the supporting actors, are highly praised. The reviewer also appreciates the film's use of natural settings, such as the Egyptian desert and Italian landscapes, which serve as a stark contrast to the brutality and violence of war.

The reviewer's tone is thoughtful and reflective, indicating that the film has had a profound impact on them. While they acknowledge the film's intensity and brutality, they also recognize its ability to evoke emotions and spark introspection. The reviewer's conclusion, ""This is not a film for relaxation.

18587,"In a critical scene, as Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas) lies in the Cave Of Swimmers, she writes something read aloud by Hana (Juliette Binoche) in which she proclaims that ""the light has gone out now, and I'm writing in the darkness..."" A sentence of such poetic beauty could not be more perfect for the cinematic brilliance of the far from tiresome The English Patient. With such a dramatic sweep that keeps one firmly on their feet, and a strength about the film that doesn't let up, this film proudly celebrates the mysteries and romances of World War II, taking elements of Casablanca and Lawrence Of Arabia along with some independence in the form of Tuscany.<br /><br />The English Patient unabashedly pulls the heartstrings and takes us through a mysterious first act, a romantic second act, and a beautiful... beautiful final act, and it isn't just the wonderful pace and setting, it's the performance of Ralph Fiennes, who keeps us sympathetic even when Count Almásy, from the very start, proves to be a thoroughly unlikable character. Usually typecast as a villain, he shows tainted, but ultimately human colours as a man taken in by a desperate love that he must fulfill.<br /><br />Many will criticize this film based on its so called ""glorification of adulterers"", but those who do know nothing. The contrasts between the two periods (before and after the plane crash seen at the start) are spectacular, as the patient is the regretting man who suffers because of what he did, the evil that was once in him now absent, whereas the man of before the crash is an individual like anyone else. He wants this woman but he cannot have her, Fiennes brings the human-like qualities out of Almásy in a way absolutely NO OTHER actor could. There couldn't have been a better actor for the job.<br /><br />So please, take these comments to heart, see the film, those who call it ""boring"" or ""despicable"" know nothing, and should be ashamed of such a one-dimensional view on the film, a view that they have neither studied nor corrected, and probably don't plan on correcting. The English Patient is the best of every film to have ever won the Best Picture Oscar, and for so many reasons, hidden in their poetic triumphs.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is a glowing tribute to the film ""The English Patient,"" praising its cinematic brilliance, poetic beauty, and outstanding performances. The reviewer is deeply moved by the film's ability to evoke emotions, describing it as a sweeping romance that ""unabashedly pulls the heartstrings."" The performance of Ralph Fiennes as Count Almásy is particularly highlighted, with the reviewer arguing that he brings a nuanced humanity to the character, making him relatable despite his flaws.

The reviewer also defends the film against potential criticisms, such as the ""glorification of adulterers,"" arguing that the film's portrayal of complex moralities is a strength, not a weakness. The contrast between the two time periods in the film is also praised, with the reviewer noting that it adds depth and complexity to the narrative.

The tone of the review is passionate and persuasive, with the reviewer urging readers to see the film and dismissing negative opinions as ""one-dimensional"" and uninformed. The review concludes by declaring ""The English Patient"" the best film to have won the Best Picture Oscar, citing its ""poetic triumphs"" as a key factor.

18588,"I have heard an awful lot about 'The English Patient' and I finally decided to get the CD and find out what all the ballyhoo was about. What I found out was a cinematic delight and should, I repeat 'should' always be watched with an open mind. If you are a religious, moral zealot, I am afraid this is not a film for you as you will fail to see the beauty of this cinematic masterpiece as you will keep on harping on the moral dilemmas this film creates. As I remember correctly before I watched this film I read the review in this site and was thoroughly disgusted by the views of that person who I quote said 'that the protagonists thoroughly deserved what they got'. When it comes to morality I agree with him but this is not the way to comment on a film of this magnificence. <br /><br />I must admit rarely have I seen such a wonderfully crafted film. I keep on hearing the background soundtrack in my subconscious. First and foremost this is a love story and yes it's an extramarital affair (moralists beware) but lets not keep focusing on that. Instead let's focus on how the story was told. It's an admixture of flashbacks and the present. Its set in the world war II and tells us the story of a survivor of a plane crash (Count Almazhy played wonderfully by Ralph Fiennes) who is looked after by an army nurse (Juliet Binoche) in war torn Italy just before the beginning of the end (defeat of the axis powers). The burn scarred patient very much in pain kept on remembering the torrid affair he had with an English woman Katherine (Kristin Scott Thomas) shown in flashbacks set in pre-war Africa. The past and the present are interwoven so adroitly in the story that you're sort of transported in the story and get the feel of a first hand viewer. The locales in the desert and in Italy are beautiful and so are the characters. I am a romantic and am not ashamed to say I had tears after it ended. Watch it with someone you truly love. The movie starts and ends with the same shot of the desert where the sand dunes twist and curves like a woman's body and it was breathtaking. The sense of loss and grief was conveyed so overwhelmingly by the actors that it makes me wonder why god! Why do we have wars that destroys beauty and the most unforgivable of all, the destruction of Innocence. <br /><br />Anyway it deservedly won a bunch of Oscars and I will go hunting for other works of director Anthony Minghella.It kind of brings back the romanticism in the David Lean genre of films.It almost reminds me of 'Lawrence of Arabia' which was also based in the desert.Happy viewing folks.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer expressing their admiration for the film ""The English Patient"" in glowing terms. The reviewer begins by warning that the film may not be suitable for those with strong moral objections to extramarital affairs, but emphasizes that the film's beauty and craftsmanship should be appreciated with an open mind. The reviewer praises the film's narrative structure, which seamlessly weaves together flashbacks and present-day scenes, transporting the viewer into the story. The reviewer is also deeply moved by the film's romanticism, admitting to having tears in their eyes by the end.

The review highlights the film's technical achievements, including its beautiful locales, stunning cinematography, and outstanding performances from the cast, particularly Ralph Fiennes and Juliet Binoche.

18592,"Have just seen the last episode, No 32, (though the site says only 30 episodes were made) and I must comment on the fact that this series was really very good and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who enjoys crime/cop stories. Supposedly all 32 were based on fact with information at the end of each episode of the court sentences imposed on the perpetrators of the crimes, this has at times been a gritty, well acted, believable and dare I say, entertaining series.

18593,"We've just watched the last of the series shown on the SBS network and will miss our weekly dose of Danish Delight. My wife and I picked up the show after the Swedish show ""The Eagle"" finished and it seemed by comparison to be a very poor substitute for our then favourite show on TV. Week by week, however, the show grew on me, and whilst not as glossy as the Swedish show and definitely grittier in terms of their investigations of everyday crimes, it certainly provided a very satisfying weekly viewing meal indeed.<br /><br />Prior to these 2 shows I had not really been a fan of the cop genre and can't say I am now but the 2 Scandinavian shows really provided us with an insight into life in those northern Euopean countries through the eyes of their special policing units.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, albeit with some initial reservations.

18594,"First off, I'm an American -- I haven't seen any comments on IMDb about this series yet from a U.S. viewer. Secondly, I work in the television business in development. So I wallow in much of the sludge that comes out of American broadcast programming. ""Unit One"" is an example of television that's a throwback to what I would attribute as '70s-style scripting, feature-wise. Namely, those films made by young autueurs who had free rein to make the dramas feel more realistic and to allow for organic character development. It tacks more along the lines of stellar British dramas like ""Cracker"" and ""Prime Suspect"" as well as Australia's brilliant ""Underbelly."" ""Unit One"" features stand-alone cases that are committed, then solved, each week. The mysteries aren't extraordinary or particularly byzantine. They usually center around one single twist, clocking in generally at the 40 minute mark, and resolution is neatly wrapped up in the 15 minutes thereafter. What makes this series a breath of fresh air is that it features main characters that you are hooked on and find relatable by episode 2. These are real, breathing, alive characters that have personal baggage, yet it's not a talky, batty type of baggage that American flotsam such as ""Grey's Anatomy"" or ""Desperate Housewives"" spoons out. These are realistic individuals whose backstories unfold leisurely over the course of the series, as if you work with them on a daily basis. After the mindless decade of ""CSI's,"" ""NCIS's,"" and ""Criminal Minds,"" along with their subsequent spawns, it's refreshing to actually sit down to watch friends you want to spend time with, as is the case with ""Unit One."" The quippy banter, the unemotional wooden dialogue, and the over-the-top jeopardy that those American series I mentioned bludgeon us with each week are absurd compared to the nuance and the quiet resonance you get with this remarkable Danish series. I'm on episode 7 of the first season, but I've already bought all four seasons and am in for the long haul. If you need explosions and farcically-hopped up testosterone, along with music by The Who and fast-cutting, neon-lit, jittery palsy-cam action with cipher-like main characters as your main diet of television drama viewing, I suggest you stay away from this series. If you are an adult with a hunger for subtle, poignant, thoughtful and, yes, sometimes straight-forward procedural crime dramas, I urge you to check this show out.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer expressing admiration for the Danish television series ""Unit One"". The reviewer, who works in television development, praises the show's realistic and nuanced approach to character development, likening it to 1970s-style scripting and comparing it favorably to acclaimed British and Australian dramas. The reviewer appreciates the show's focus on character-driven storytelling, with relatable and well-developed main characters whose backstories unfold naturally over the course of the series. The reviewer also commends the show's subtle and thoughtful approach to procedural crime drama, which is a refreshing change from the more sensational and formulaic American crime dramas.

The reviewer's enthusiasm for the show is evident throughout the review, with phrases such as ""breath of fresh air"", ""remarkable Danish series"", and ""I'm in for the long haul"" conveying their excitement and commitment to the show.

18598,"Of course I'm a bit prejudiced but for the time it was the most accurate portrayal of Marines ever shown on the big screen.<br /><br />I was at Camp Pendleton undergoing infantry training when Webb brought his crew down to film some outdoor scenes and our company was asked to participate.

18601,"THE D.I. (4 outta 5 stars) Wow, I certainly did not expect to be enjoying this movie as much as I did. I had never even heard of it until I saw it sitting in the discount video bin one day. I figured Jack Webb playing an army drill instructor might be good for a chuckle but figured the drama would pale in comparison to such recent movie D.I.s as portrayed in ""Full Metal Jacket"" or ""An Officer and a Gentleman"". Boy, was I wrong. This is probably the best work Webb has ever done... far and away better than his one-note ""Dragnet"" performances. The delivery of his tough guy dialogue is just brilliant... done in his patented deadpan monotone and yet you *know* that the guy means every word of it. The story might seem a little hokey compared to the grittier military movies that have followed but I still found the movie fascinating and compelling. Even a completely unnecessarily musical interlude in an army nightclub had me hooked. Anyone know where I can get a copy of that terrific Ray Coniff song ""If'n You Don't, Somebody Else Will""? Webb plays the toughest dang drill instructor ever... and he's under pressure to kick out the deadbeat Private Owen but, by golly, he sees a man buried somewhere in that sissyboy and he's gonna drag him out kicking and screaming! Great stuff!",Positive,positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer expressing surprise at how much they enjoyed the movie. They initially had low expectations, thinking it would be a campy, humorous take on a drill instructor, but instead found themselves thoroughly engaged and impressed. The reviewer praises Jack Webb's performance, calling it the best work he's ever done, and highlights his effective delivery of tough-guy dialogue in his signature deadpan style. The reviewer also appreciates the story, despite acknowledging that it might seem a bit dated compared to more modern military movies. Even a seemingly out-of-place musical interlude is mentioned as captivating. The reviewer's enthusiasm is palpable, with phrases like ""Boy, was I wrong"" and ""Great stuff!"" conveying their excitement.

The reviewer's glowing assessment of the film, Webb's performance, and the story's ability to hold their attention all contribute to a very positive review.

18602,"I was a Marine at Camp Pendleton when the D.I. came out (1st Marine Division, 11th Marine Regiment, 3rd Battalion, I-Battery). I still remember standing in line with a bunch of other Marines to see the movie at the ""Star"" theater in Oceanside, California.<br /><br />We did not remotely expect the movie to portray everything we experienced in boot camp but we were all pleasantly surprised at how well done the movie was. The idea of using real Marines in the movie was a great idea (I believe they were all real Drill Instructors too). As good an actor as Jack Webb was, he just couldn't ""call cadence"" like a real Marine Drill Instructor.<br /><br />All of us got a laugh when the ""problem"" recruit's mother came to boot camp to talk to the Captain. Never in a million years would this have happened, but that's Hollywood, and we didn't let that episode keep us from enjoying the movie.<br /><br />I went through boot camp at MCRD in San Diego during the summer of 1956, and at that time there was virtually no limits as to what the D.I.'s could do to you. The ""Ribbon Creek"" event at Parris Island had not yet affected boot camp, at least not at MCRD - San Diego.<br /><br />I agree with what a lot of the other reviewers have commented on concerning Sgt. Moore's ""stiffness"" around his girl friend. I believe this was just Webb's acting style, and although they could have deleted this part of the movie, it didn't really hurt the production that much.<br /><br />One minor note, the character (uncredited) of ""Pvt. Rodriguez"" was played by one of my Drill Instructors, Sgt. Peter J. O'Neill. Sgt. O'Neill used to tell us that some day he wanted to be an actor. We secretly laughed at this, but he surprised us all. He was a great Drill Instructor, and I thought he did well in his bit part. Also, he really did enjoy throwing knives. He often demonstrated his skill to us that summer in boot camp. I have often wondered if he is still alive.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer sharing their personal experience as a Marine at Camp Pendleton and their fond memories of watching the movie ""The D.I."" at the ""Star"" theater in Oceanside, California. The reviewer praises the film's portrayal of boot camp, noting that it was surprisingly accurate and well-done, especially with the use of real Marines and Drill Instructors. The reviewer also appreciates the authenticity of the film, acknowledging that some creative liberties were taken, such as the scene with the ""problem"" recruit's mother visiting boot camp.

The reviewer's personal connection to the film is evident, as they share their own experiences at MCRD in San Diego during the summer of 1956. They also provide interesting anecdotes, such as the fact that one of their Drill Instructors, Sgt. Peter J. O'Neill, played a minor role in the film and was a skilled knife-thrower.

The only minor criticism mentioned is Sgt. Moore's stiffness around his girlfriend, which the reviewer attributes to Jack Webb's acting style. However, this does not detract from the reviewer's overall positive assessment of the film.

18603,"Well as you can see, I got to this party quite late but, have the advantage of reading all the previous entries before making my comments. I found this site by happen chance, when I was looking for other Marine Corps films. So, let me start by telling you that I played a Marine Boot in the movie, Pvt. Labarsky, and was stationed at MCRDep, San Diego at the time. Jack Webb and his crew selected 15 Permanent Personnel, of which some of us had the speaking parts, and another 15 Marines that had just completed Boot Camp. That made up the Platoon and the Marines who portrayed the various ""DIs"". To the best of my recollection, The Capt. and Pvt. Owens (Don Dubbins) were not in the Marines. We spent about three weeks up in Hollywood (Studio City Film Lot), CA shooting the section of the movie that we were involved with, and then they completed the other shots after we left.<br /><br />So as I ramble along here, let me clarify some of what has been questioned in previous entries as best I can. ""Cuff Daddy"" was commenting about the ability of our Platoon to yell ""Yes Sir"" without moving and etc,, Yes we did the yelling for the Sound Guys, and it was while shooting the scene. As you fellow Marines remember, when the DI or who ever started to ask a question and before they completed it, you had already taken your breath of air enabling you to yell at the top of your lungs the proper response. That is how it was done.<br /><br />""74Sooner"" commented about walking through the same building at Paris Island, however, as I mentioned earlier all the scenes were shot in Studio City, CA . They were built from photos taken at Paris Island and from on site trips and Marine advisers from Paris Island. Sorry, you were in the real buildings, not the sets.<br /><br />""schappe1"" brought up many good points, but, about the incident with the platoon at Paris Island at the time all that jack Webb said to us was, ""The movie came about because of the accident, and the Marine Corps didn't want to put out anything that would impact any of the family members of the Marines that died that night. Although, the Marine Corps would provide any Marines and assistance needed for a movie answering to the public why a Marine DI does what he does"".<br /><br />As mentioned by a few of you, I also at the time we were shooting the scenes caught my self thinking this dialog has been cleaned up to much and obviously isn't how it goes down in real life. Back in the 50's,that is how it had to be done.<br /><br />One story I would like to pass on is about the interaction that occurred between us Marines and the Movie Crew, and between the Movie Crew and Jack Webb. From the start by custom the Marines replied ""Yes Sir"" to anybody that moved. Going into the second week it was getting more common to hear ""Yes Sir"" coming from all directions. On stage someone would bark out a request for something to be done with the lighting and from out of nowhere up on a catwalk above the set a reply of ""Yes Sir"" would sound out. To all of this at one of our informal gatherings, Jack Webb stated. ""If I had known that I would have gotten this much respect from this crew, I would have brought you guys up here years ago."" There was a Lt. brought up from San Diego to play the role of the DI from the other platoon and the one Jack Webb fights with, but during one shooting secessions He was up to take number 32, and still Webb kept trying to work him through how he wanted it done and didn't show any lack of patience with him. The next day they used the Paris Island adviser who was a DI Sgt. from Paris Island and He worked out fine.<br /><br />At the time I was somewhat of a camera buff and got to know the Still Camera Man to get some pointer from him and as it turned out He would give me still shots and some of the 35mm film of the daily shooting that were not going to be used. Those film strips I cut up and made slides out of them.

I knew a lot of Drill Instructors and a lot of recruits. I think the movie is as close as any movie to showing the life of a recruit and that of a Drill Instructor. Without a doubt, I think it is the best thing Jack Webb ever did. If you have been in the military, you need to see this movie. This was the way it was.

18610,"I saw this movie on TV back in the 60s and it still stands up well even after brilliant performances as a DI by R. Lee Ermey, Lou Gossett and even Frank Sutton (in a comic vein) on Gomer Pyle USMC. I wasn't in the service but my brother had a recording of a Drill Instructor in the Air Force and it was scary. Others in the family who were Marines told me that Ermey and even Sutton were pretty spot on in their roles. The only thing missing in ""The D. I."" is the language. In 1958 they couldn't yet use profanity on film, yet Jack Webb came across pretty damned tough without it. I think it's his best role ever. In Dragnet he was quite stiff I'll admit, though not as bad as George Raft, but he used it only to effect in ""The D. I."" You never forget the funeral for the dead flea! The romantic part was just to stretch the movie, but didn't really interfere with the basic plot. Don Dubbins was pretty good to but he never surpassed this film in his career. As far as patriotism, Jack Webb was TV's John Wayne. He carried it a bit too far in some Dragnet episodes, but not in ""The D. I.""

PVT Owens is like many who found himself in a lot more difficult situation than he bargained for. Like so many he joined the Marine Corps for all the wrong reasons. My Drill Intructors were more like GySgt Hartman than TSgt Jim Moore. A lot more. The DI is more Korean Era and Full Metal Jacket is more Viet Nam Era.

18613,"Hey there Army Sgt. I'm sorry dude but being a SGT in the Army and being in the Army National Guard does not make you qualified to comment on a Marine movie.

The reviewer also disagrees with the Army Sergeant's perceived outdated views on boot camp, arguing that modern recruits are smarter and more dedicated, and that demoralizing tactics are no longer necessary or effective.

Throughout the review, the tone is assertive and dismissive, with the reviewer implying that the Army Sergeant lacks the necessary experience and understanding to comment on Marine culture. The reviewer's use of phrases like ""get a clue"" and ""what do I know"" is sarcastic and condescending, emphasizing their own authority and credibility as a Marine veteran.

18614,"Jack Webb's movie 'The D.I' came about from the real life investigation into the deaths of several trainees in a swamp in Paris Isle in the 50's. As always, Webb, being the patriot that he is, came to the defense much like all the rest of his shows. I actually found this movie tame by 1957 standards. I served in the Army and can understand the intensity of the training at Parris Island (Camp Death by some)so this movie can never come close as does 'Full Metal Jacket'. I think this is a good movie which is more patriot than it is actual. But again, think of the time period it was made (1957) and what could be allowed and said on film at that time. I have always found Jack Webb to be clean cut and very loyal. I know many have criticized the film as one-sided and government propaganda. If you feel this way, watch 'Full Metal Jacket' with R Lee Ermey. I am a Webb fan and enjoy the movie for it's merit, not accuracy. As I have said, Webb believed in this country and held institutions to high moral standards (LAPD-Dragnet,Adam 12, Emergency etc).

The reviewer seems to appreciate the film's old-school, no-nonsense approach to storytelling, which is reflected in the lack of modern cinematic elements like explosions, sex, and a hip soundtrack. Overall, the review is a glowing endorsement of the film, celebrating its unique qualities and strong characters.

18617,"I haven't seen this fine movie in 50 years but I'm entering a comment on it anyway.<br /><br />While JACK WEBB'S movie was no doubt intended purely as an entertainment --- showing Marine basic training at Parris Island in realistic terms as a tough character-building exercise -- it was said the military was afraid the movie would discourage recruitment's. It did not work out that way. The movie showed that entering the Marines was a greater challenge than most young people ever realized, and (guess what?) being offered a king-sized challenge was exactly what many guys wanted. I personally knew lots of guys that joined the Marines shortly after seeing THE DI. Lines at recruitment centers were suddenly so long the Marines had more recruits than they could handle.<br /><br />So it goes. America will always have youth seeking to make themselves into the best --- while the slackers and born-losers limp along to nowhere. <br /><br />What we DON'T have in 2007 is any films that inspire patriotism, devotion to duty of any kind, positive values, et cetera. What we DO have is films that inspire the airhead-ed to be airheads, the beer drinkers to guzzle beer, other negative values. Exhibit #1 is that the airhead teen travesty and beer guzzling epic SUPERBAD is now #81 in the All Time Great Films list. Values? What'cha mean, values?",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is largely positive, but not specifically about the movie ""The D.I."" itself. Instead, it uses the movie as a springboard to discuss the impact it had on recruitment and the values it promoted. The reviewer reminisces about how the film's portrayal of Marine basic training as a challenging and character-building experience actually increased recruitment, as many young people were drawn to the idea of overcoming a difficult challenge. The reviewer contrasts this with modern films, which they believe promote negative values and lack patriotism and devotion to duty.

The tone of the review is nostalgic and critical of modern society, with the reviewer lamenting the lack of films that inspire positive values. The reviewer's criticism of modern films, specifically ""Superbad,"" is a tangent that takes away from the focus on ""The D.I."" However, the reviewer's overall sentiment towards ""The D.I."" is one of admiration and appreciation for its ability to inspire young people to strive for excellence.

18618,"Jack Webb finally gives something besides his usual wooden indian performance. He played the epitome of the jarhead, brainwashed, storm the beaches, semper fi, bonehead military idiot. The Corps before all else, even humanity. This great film showed the idiosy of boot camp to it's fullest. 4 stars.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, praising Jack Webb's performance as a departure from his usual wooden acting style. The reviewer commends Webb for portraying a stereotypical, gung-ho Marine who embodies the ""jarhead"" mentality, prioritizing the Corps above all else. The reviewer's tone is sarcastic, using phrases like ""brainwashed"" and ""bonehead military idiot"" to describe the character, but this is meant to highlight the film's success in depicting the absurdity and intensity of boot camp.

The reviewer shares a personal experience of being scared by the movie when it first aired in 1972 and, upon re-watching it, still finds it effective. The praise is primarily directed towards Elizabeth Ashley's performance, with Ben Gazzara and a young Michael Douglas receiving more neutral assessments. The reviewer notes that the film's slow pace, predictability, and tame death scenes are somewhat mitigated by the fact that it's a TV movie, implying that certain concessions must be made for the medium.

The reviewer's enthusiasm for the film is evident in their description of the telephone calls, which still evoke a strong emotional response.

18621,"This is another of my favorite Columbos. It sports a top-notch cast, including John Cassavetes, who was never handsomer or sexier, Anjanette Comer, Myrna Loy, and Blythe Danner. Now here's something I've always wondered - had Gwenyth Paltrow been born when this episode was shot, or was Danner pregnant at the time? Thanks to IMDb, I have my answer - she was five months' pregnant. Now I can really feel ancient.<br /><br />Cassavetes plays a brilliant conductor whose marriage to Danner was apparently to use the social connections of her mother (Loy). He has a mistress on the side, Anjanette Comer, a prominent pianist, but she announces she wants more. She's sick of being back street. On the night of their concert, he gets rid of her and makes it look like suicide. Columbo picks up a few problems immediately. One thing he notices: ""You have a beautiful woman here - bedroom eyes - she has money, a body, and a career. Where's the man?"" It's wonderful to see Falk and good friend Cassavetes together. There's a very funny episode at the vet with Columbo's Bassett. Everyone in the cast is great.<br /><br />This is one of the episodes that made Columbo the classic series it became.",Positive,positive,positive,positive,"This review is extremely positive, with the reviewer enthusiastically praising the episode of Columbo being discussed. The reviewer starts by highlighting the impressive cast, including John Cassavetes, Anjanette Comer, Myrna Loy, and Blythe Danner, and shares a personal anecdote about discovering that Danner was pregnant during filming. The reviewer then summarizes the plot, focusing on Cassavetes' character, a conductor who murders his mistress, and Columbo's subsequent investigation. The reviewer praises the episode's humor, particularly in a scene at the vet with Columbo's Basset hound.

Throughout the review, the tone is lighthearted and celebratory, with the reviewer clearly delighted by the episode.

Answer: Positive"
18622,"Alex Benedict (John Cassavetes) is an orchestra conductor having an secret affair with his pianist. When she threatens to expose him and create a scandal if he doesn't leave his wife, he sees he has no choice but to murder her and make it look as if she had committed suicide. Too bad for him our rumpled detective, Lt. Columbo (Peter Falk), is on the case.<br /><br />Stephen Bochco has written another razor-sharp episode for the series, following marvelous detail with marvelous detail. We watch the villain commit his murder and set up his alibi for about twenty-five minutes, and we're completely engrossed. Then when Columbo appears on the scene, it gets even better.<br /><br />We first see Columbo after the murder (as per usual). This time he's at the vet with his new dog. Scenes of purely comic relief are usually the weakest ones in the show (think Columbo's discomfort over the nude model in ""Suitable for Framing""). Columbo is hilarious when he's dithering or bumbling deliberately in order to trip up his quarry; but too many writers make the mistake of showing him in a ridiculous light when he's with non-suspects. Bochco, by contrast, shows Columbo a bit awkward with his new pet in a handful of low-key scenes that are funny and artfully integrated into the story. (And I'm grateful he didn't strain for a punchline to Columbo's quest to give the dog a name. As far as we learn, the dog remains nameless.) Bochco gives Columbo some of his best moments in this episode, and Peter Falk makes the most of them. He's particularly good in a monologue where he expresses disbelief that anyone could kill herself, much less this brilliant and beautiful young pianist. And he's even better in his scenes playing cat-and-mouse with Cassavetes. That these two long-time friends and collaborators would play off each other brilliantly is to be expected; and that's what we get. Notice how Alex Benedict can't help but admire the deceptively dimwitted Columbo, even as the brilliant detective is tightening the noose around his neck.<br /><br />Bochco makes the most of every situation in his script. When Columbo goes to question Benedict's snooty mechanic, of course  of course!  he asks the man to look at his own beat-up heap. And when Benedict finds Columbo at the Hollywood Bowl before rehearsal, of course  of course!  he's on the piano playing ""Chopsticks."" And what should our audacious lieutenant bring with him but the victim's typewriter with the phony suicide note still in the roller.<br /><br />Columbo also has good scenes with a precocious little girl (Dawn Frame) and the lovely Blythe Danner, who plays Cassavetes's wife. It's nice to see Myrna Loy show up as Danner's mother, though she does little with her minor role.<br /><br />The director Nicholas Colasanto (who also acted, most notably as Coach in ""Cheers"") does a perfectly creditable job, though he follows the lead of nearly every other ""Columbo"" director by adding one or two silly flourishes. Scenes end by going out of focus and begin by coming into focus. Then there's that bit where Cassavetes sees the carnation he dropped at the scene of the crime  and we see a zoom-in shot of it reflected in his sunglasses. There's also one scene with Myrna Loy and group of old fogies that is atrociously performed by everyone except Cassavetes.<br /><br />These are quibbles, though. This is a splendidly entertaining episode, the kind that made me a ""Columbo"" fan.",Positive,positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the writing, acting, and direction of this episode of the TV series ""Columbo"". The reviewer commends Stephen Bochco's script for its razor-sharp detail and engaging storyline, which keeps the audience engrossed from the start. The reviewer also highlights the excellent performances of Peter Falk as Lt. Columbo and John Cassavetes as the villainous Alex Benedict, noting their brilliant chemistry and cat-and-mouse interactions. The review also appreciates the humor and wit infused into the episode, particularly in Columbo's scenes with his new dog and his interactions with other characters.

The reviewer does mention some minor quibbles with the direction, such as the use of focus effects and a zoom-in shot, but these are deemed insignificant compared to the episode's overall excellence. The review concludes by stating that this episode is a prime example of what makes ""Columbo"" a great series, making it a ""splendidly entertaining"" watch.

Answer: Positive"
18623,"My first 'Columbo'. Rather enjoyed it. Great format, and Peter Falk's character extremely good...wonderfully quirky, he can take his place next to Poirot, Miss Marple, and also the likes of Marlowe and Rick Diamond. I can see why this series has such a following. <br /><br />As a professional musician, I HAVE to say a few things. First of all, a conductor who merely produces these pedestrian performances of the most basic examples of the repertoire (Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, Strauss Waltzes, Beethoven...) is never going to have a house like that or fame like that or cars like that, much less be called a genius. And the conducting that the actor does is so bad as to be laughable. No orchestra would take him seriously. <br /><br />There are several little things too, such as his rehearsal of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik (why rehearse it when they've just performed it for TV? Any orchestral musician would be able to play it in his or her sleep anyway...). His instructions to the ensemble are downright nonsensical, and when Columbo asks Blythe Danner what 'quasi fantasia' means, she says it's 'Latin'. It's Italian, as are the vast majority of musical instructions. <br /><br />And finally, no two great musicians would EVER have the following interchange: ""Play something."" ""What should I play?"" ""Chopin"". Music is their job and passion, they know it well. Something far more specific would be asked for, and offered! <br /><br />I know. I should get out more...",Positive,Positive,Mixed,positive,"This review is a mixed assessment of the Columbo series, with both positive and negative comments. On the positive side, the reviewer enjoys the format and praises Peter Falk's portrayal of the titular character, comparing him favorably to other iconic detectives. The reviewer also acknowledges the show's popularity and can understand why it has a dedicated following.

However, the reviewer, a professional musician, takes issue with the depiction of a conductor and the music-related aspects of the episode. They criticize the conductor's performances, rehearsal methods, and instructions as unrealistic and inaccurate. The reviewer also points out specific mistakes, such as the misuse of musical terms and the implausible dialogue between musicians.

Despite these criticisms, the reviewer's tone is lighthearted and humorous, with a touch of self-deprecation (""I know. I should get out more...""). The negative comments are specific and constructive, suggesting that the reviewer is invested in the show and wants to see it done well.

18624,"This Columbo episode is one of the better and perhaps one of my personal favorites. The cast includes Rosemary's Baby John Cassavetes as the maestro, his wife played by Blythe Danner (Gwyneth Paltrow's mom) and his mother-in-law played by Myrna Loy (one of America's greatest leading actresses in film of our time). Anyway I disagree with anybody who criticizes against this film. This episode is one of my favorites because you have an excellent cast who do a superb job in performing. I love watching Columbo with his beloved dog who he never names in the series. This time, the episode focuses in on classical music at the Hollywood Bowl, one of L.A.'s attractions.

18625,"After repeatedly saying how brilliant so many Columbo episodes are, it's time to honour an episode with maximum points. ""Etude In Black"" is not 100 percent perfect, but it's certainly more than 90 percent...maybe 96 or 97! <br /><br />Last week I reviewed ""Just Married"" and compared it unfavourably to ""Meet The Parents"". Well here's one of the parents, Blythe Danner, in a much earlier role as the wife of famous orchestral conductor Alex Benedict, played by the legend that is John Cassavetes. Alex has been having an affair with Jennifer Wells, a girl in the orchestra (not his first affair, one suspects). She is blackmailing Alex to leave his wife, but as his wife's mother holds the purse strings for the orchestra, Alex doesn't think it'd be such a smart move to destroy his career and marriage overnight. Instead he hatches a plot to sneak out of the concert hall before a performance and murder his young lover while making it look like a suicide.<br /><br />Enter Columbo and guess what? It takes him about two seconds to realise that homicide is more likely than suicide. It doesn't take much longer for Columbo to connect Alex to the victim, and soon he's following him around wherever he goes. Even though Columbo is certain Alex is his man, it actually takes quite a while and a few false leads (none of which Columbo really swallows) before he has the vital piece of evidence.<br /><br />Along the way there are some top-notch extra characters, ranging from the precocious young neighbour of Jennifer Wells and the English mechanic who sounds like he would be more at home on Coronation Street, through to the bedraggled looking brass player who nearly finds himself fitted up for the murder (he had also been seeing Jennifer Wells, the busy girl!). And there's even a brief cameo from Commandant Lassard from the Police Academy films. As with Leslie Nielsen in ""Lady In Waiting"", it's impossible to take him seriously (I bet you're thinking of that speech he made at the podium, aren't you?!) <br /><br />But it's Blythe Danner, John Cassavetes and Peter Falk who steal the show here. Blythe is absolutely divine as Mrs Benedict. From the moment she spots Alex dialling Jennifer Wells' number from memory, she feels deeply troubled by exactly what their relationship was. It's a masterful performance as she struggles to trust Alex despite her intuition telling her something is very, very wrong. Columbo doesn't help matters by interrupting her game of tennis to ask her impertinent questions about Alex's relations with members of his orchestra.<br /><br />As for John Cassavetes, well it's a shame he didn't make any repeat appearances as Columbo villains, because he could have been up there with Jack Cassidy and Patrick McGoohan as one of the all-time greats of the show. But this performance is superb! He's another one who falls into the ""highly irritated"" category, losing all patience with Columbo rather than befriending him and indulging him. Despite this, when the game is finally up he does grudgingly acknowledge Columbo's genius.<br /><br />Well it's a really, really fantastic show. It loses a couple of very small points for its rather sledgehammer view of classical music, as highlighted by many of the posters here, but none of these have any bearing on the logic of the story or the characterisations. And at least the music is good, dramatic and exciting!<br /><br />Finally, if you haven't come across it, there is an absolutely amazing clip of John Cassavetes and Peter Falk on the Dick Cavett show from the early 70s. I'm totally convinced Steve Coogan watched this clip and based Alan Partridge on it. Everything about the clip resembles Knowing Me Knowing You, from the cringeworthy introduction to the total humiliation of Cavett by his guests. Even the orchestra get in on the act, playing circus music while Falk, Cassavetes and their friend Ben Gazzara fool about and ridicule the host.<br /><br />It might not be strictly relevant to this review, but the Cavett show clip gives a nice insight into the deep friendship and professional relationship between Peter Falk and John Cassavetes. It's clear to see from the quality of ""Etude In Black"" just how well the pair worked together!",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer praising almost every aspect of the Columbo episode ""Etude In Black"".

18626,"Story-wise this isn't among the best or most cleverly written Columbo movie but the movie is extremely well made, with excellent directing and truly fine acting.<br /><br />Especially the acting within this movie attracts the attention. Director Nicholas Colasanto did a great job with the actors in the movie. Appereantly he allowed Peter Falk and John Cassavetes lots of space to play with, also since both are being credited on here as uncredited directors of this movie. Must be part of his directing style to allow the actors this much room. It works out extremely well for this movie. Perhaps he did this because Colasanto himself also used to work as an actor. He is perhaps best known for playing the role of Coach in the hit-series ""Cheers"", from the very start of it in 1982 until his death in 1985.<br /><br />So Peter Falk seems better than ever before in his role as Lt. Columbo. Also veteran actor John Cassavetes does a real great job as the movie its murderer and is a good match for the lieutenant. Beside them, the movie also features Myrna Loy. A big star from the silent movie era and also Pat Morita, in a small early role.<br /><br />But not just the acting-directing within the movie is real good. Visually and technically it's also a really great made movie, with slow long shots, without the use of any cuts. Also obviously the reason why this movie is longer than most Columbo movies. It really takes its time to set up things and tell its story. The movie also features a couple of nice artistic and experimental kind of shots. Of course all really fitting for the '70's.<br /><br />But like I said before, story-wise this just isn't among the best Columbo movies. Also the clues being left out for the lieutenant are a bit too obvious this time. It makes the murderer come across as a bit dumb, like he didn't thought his plan over good enough, while the character obviously is an intelligent man. Columbo this time also tries to irritate the suspect and other characters a bit more than he usually tries to do, in order to solve the crime. This and Peter Falk's different acting approach are a reason why his character might come across as different than he does in other Columbo movies. But different does not mean worse in this case.<br /><br />The movie also features a quite good musical score by Richard DeBenedictis, who after this became sort of the steady composer for the Columbo movies. <br /><br />A great Columbo movie to watch!<br /><br />8/10",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting the exceptional directing, acting, and technical aspects of the Columbo movie. The reviewer praises the director, Nicholas Colasanto, for allowing the actors, particularly Peter Falk and John Cassavetes, to shine in their roles. The acting is described as ""truly fine,"" with Falk delivering a standout performance as Lt. Columbo. The reviewer also appreciates the cinematography, noting the use of slow, long shots without cuts, which adds to the movie's unique style. The score by Richard DeBenedictis is also commended.

While the reviewer acknowledges that the story is not among the best in the Columbo series, they emphasize that the excellent acting, directing, and technical aspects make up for it.

18627,"Being a self confessed slasher addict means that it's very rare that I get the chance to review many bigger budgeted movies with creditable casts. Aside from James Mangold's successful box office draw Identity; there have not been any big name entries since the Scream trilogy once again put Wes Craven's name back on the Hollywood map. That's why Mark Malone's The Last Stop  a mystery thriller with blatant slasher overtones, instantly intrigued me. With a decent line-up including Adam Beach and Jurgen Prochnow and an intriguing soundtrack that even finds space for Lynn Anderson's Rose Garden, I must admit that the initial signs were very positive for this claustrophobic feature. To the best of my knowledge there have only ever been three other snow-bound slashers, unless of course you consider Demon Possessed to fit in the category. The first slice and dice on the ice was the bone-dry Satan's Blade, then came the Lisa Loring cheese-feast that was Blizzard of Blood and the enjoyable Shredder followed some fourteen years later.<br /><br />During an extreme blizzard, state trooper Jason (Adam Beach) battles through the snow to reach a remote lodge in the Colorado Mountains. His task is to inform the guests that the road is closed and they must stay for at least one more night until a path can be cleared through the hazardous conditions. This news doesn't go down to well with the suspicious bunch, which includes two troublemaking brothers (Callum Keith Rennie and Peter Flemming), a truck driver that really doesn't want to hang around (William S. Taylor), a randy couple of lovers (Winston Rekert and Amy Adamson) and Jason's ex-girlfriend Nancy (Rose McGowan). The motel owners (Jurgen Prochnow and P. Lynn Johnson) aren't overjoyed by the news either, but they offer rooms to the stranded guests and attempt to calm the tense situation. Things take a turn for the worse when Jason finds a mutilated body and a bag full of stolen cash lying in the snow behind the cafe. Just like a chapter out of an Agatha Christie mystery, the lodgers begin dieing at the hands of a masked assailant that seems intent to re-claim the money. With so many dodgy characters to choose from and no way of leaving the crime scene, Jason has to attempt to stop the maniac before he kills again <br /><br />A good mystery needs at least a handful of shady suspects who each have a credible motive, a remote location that no one can escape from and a smart protagonist to help unravel the clues. Fortunately The Last Stop provides each of those essential ingredients in a thriller that has its equal moments of brilliance and downright stupidity. The film kicks off superbly as the dubious personalities clash in a claustrophobic environment that manages to keep the tension running high throughout the runtime. Malone keeps the interest levels raised as each character unveils their own reasons to attract some of the suspicion, and to be fair the essential twist isn't one that you'll guess easily. In fact I found myself watching the movie through once again to see if I could pick up on any hints that I missed first time around. Unfortunately when the maniac is revealed to be an over the top psycho that wisecracks like a comic book bad guy, The Last Stop forfeits a huge amount of credibility. Thankfully all is not lost when an unexpected and brilliantly orchestrated plot twist salvages the film's finale.<br /><br />Similarities can be drawn with the excellent Identity, as the two plots are almost interchangeable. James Mangold's effort has to be the better of the two mainly because of the star billing of John Cusack and the ever-reliable Ray Liotta. With that said though Adam Beach does a good enough job in the lead, while Jurgen Prochnow, Amy Adamson and the brilliant Callum Keith Rennie add some credible support. Rose McGowan acts as conceitedly in this role as she probably does from day to day in reality and Winston Rekert started fantastically before going completely overboard with the film's climax. If you're a die-hard slasher fan that's watching this for some bloody killings then you're going to be disappointed. The balaclava-wearing psychopath only pops up once and the rest of the murders are committed off-screen. But as I said earlier Malone's directorial talent means that the suspense is never too far off the boil and you can forgive the few flaws because the positives just about triumph.<br /><br />The Last Stop is well worth a look for slasher addicts and movie fans alike. Yes there are a handful of negatives, but overall this is a solid example of emerging Hollywood talents. If you liked Identity then certainly give this a try",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review of ""The Last Stop"" is generally positive, highlighting the film's strengths in creating a suspenseful and intriguing mystery thriller with a claustrophobic atmosphere. The reviewer, a self-proclaimed slasher addict, appreciates the film's unique blend of mystery and slasher elements, praising its ability to keep the tension high throughout the runtime. The cast, including Adam Beach, Jurgen Prochnow, and Callum Keith Rennie, is commended for their performances. The reviewer also notes that the film's twist is unexpected and well-executed, making it a worthwhile watch.

However, the review is not entirely glowing, as the reviewer criticizes the film's flaws, such as the over-the-top portrayal of the psychopath and some of the supporting actors' performances. Additionally, the reviewer notes that fans of bloody killings might be disappointed, as most of the murders occur off-screen.

Despite these criticisms, the reviewer concludes that ""The Last Stop"" is a solid example of emerging Hollywood talent and is worth watching, especially for fans of the mystery thriller genre.

18628,"I also saw The Last Stop at the Moving Pictures Film Festival in Prince George. I have to confess, the only reason I went to see it is because I am a huge Callum Keith Rennie fan. And he didn't let me down. He gave a good performance of a rather unsympathetic character and provided about the only comic relief in the whole movie.<br /><br />The movie itself is the usual 'lots of bad people trapped in a snow storm together' storyline, but it did have a couple of twists that kept me guessing. The characterizations were strong and the whole cast performed fairly well. The only problems I had with the cast was Rose McGowan.

18629,"What makes this low budget production one of my favorite movies? Not kidding, i was watching it already 10 times or so and did not get tired. Is it the tender melancholia throughout the whole thing? Is it the similarity to classics like ""Niagara""? I was thinking a long time about that. And figured it out: I guess it is: there is no hero, there are only people. Some try to be good. Some gave up trying to be good. Some are hopeless cases but carry still the spunk of being human inside. It is the story of a catastrophic night in a motel at the end of the world. One way the catastrophe is nothing but the end of a chain of coincidences. The other way this night reveals the logical consequents of this peoples lives because they are in a certain constellation cut off the rest of the world.

18630,"This movie is a little slow in the the beginning, for about the first 10 minutes or so. But once it kicks in you can't turn it off. Adam Beach and Rose McGowan play the best parts and are great at their acting job. You would never be able to guess who the killer is.

However, the film was very good too. Some parts of this movie are really good.<br /><br />The film has great action also. The mystery is pretty hard to figure out and Rose [McGowan] does some ""Oscar-worthy"" acting towards the end of the film, but I don't want to give anything away.

18632,"I was fortunate enough to see The Last Stop here where I live at the Moving Pictures Film Festival (for those of you that don't know, the Moving Pictures Film Festival is a tour of Canadian made film in Canada). I was told just before the movie started that it was the world premiere and that it was on the verge of getting an American distribution deal which added to my excitement.<br /><br />I'm a big horror movie fan, and yes, I love the Scream trilogy as well. So when I found out that Rose McGowan was doing a Ten Little Indians type of movie I knew that I was in for a treat. Rose McGowan was the biggest name actor/actress at the entire festival.<br /><br />The best way I can describe it without giving away too much of the plot is that it's not quite like Scream. And it certainly is worth seeing. It's set in the middle of a snowstorm (it was filmed in Vancouver, B.C., Canada) at a mountaintop motel, which adds to the suspense. Rose McGowan puts in a great performance as the-girl-next-door(?!) along with the rest of the cast. And as for what happens at the end, well, the only thing I'll say is that you'll never guess the ending.<br /><br />Sadly, it probably won't make it into mainstream North American theatres because the only decent money maker in it is Rose McGowan.

18634,"The plot starts out interesting, however, towards the end too many die in too short a time, turning the thriller-mystery aspect of the story into a slaughter.<br /><br />The only true highlights were Adam Beach and Jürgen Prochnow, who were once again their excellent selves. Nice try with an inappropriate last third, though a good ending.",Positive,"Mixed, but overall: Negative",Mixed,negative,"This review is mixed, but ultimately leans towards a negative assessment.

I have heard the Merman cast album, the Angela Lansbury album, I have seen Tyne Daly live, and I've seen the Rosalind Russell movie countless times. I think Bette is if not the best, then tied with the best. She captures not just the bravura, but also the pathos of Mama Rose. I was never a Natalie Wood fan, so I really enjoyed Cynthia Gibb, in what is arguably her best role. Everything from the costumes to the sets to the supporting performances is wonderful.

18640,"This is easily one of my favorite musicals of all time. Bette Midler comes as close to real magic on screen as anyone has in her turn as Gypsy Lee's blustery, bosomy, brave and very scary mother. She evokes a sense of desperation that is at times both comic and tragic but always genuine and quite beautiful. Such charm and grit she is indeed a pioneer woman without a frontier.

18641,"""Gypsy"" is possibly the greatest musical ever written, so it's too bad that it's film version was such a disappointment. To make up for that, we have this re-make which, if not flawless, is an enjoyable and well done adaption of the musical. The script is completely accurate, all the songs included, and the staging remains close to the original Jerome Robbins' staging. Bette Midler is a deft choice for Rose, her singing and personality Merman-esquire, and her acting splendid. Peter Reigert is a fine Herby, if not a great singer, and Cynthia Gibb is a straight forward, natural Louise.

18643,"Based on the memoirs of Gypsy Rose Lee, who painted a much more affectionate picture of their mother than did her sister, actress ""Baby"" June Havoc, in her autobiography, ""Early Havoc"" on which ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"" was loosely based. I saw Ethyl Merman in the original Broadway production of Gypsy, and she was great as ""Mama Rose"" but certainly more ""Merman"" than Rose.

18644,"This film, Blade Master, may be cheap, clumsy in appearance and it is sometimes, but it shares thoughts on problems that are way beyond the era this film is set in. Ator is the chosen one that has to protect the earth against a terrible weapon, that is compared in an unforgettable and unpredictable way to the atomic weapon. He goes through obstacles as a witful character who is just more than muscle power, although he has quite is lot. I would say this aspect of the movie makes it surpass a film like Conan the barbarian, which is the least I can say, quite brainless. It doesn't diminish in any ways the great adventure movie that is Conan, but it gives Ator his wholesomeness that he shares not with the barbarian. For a lower budget movie, this film does good in terms of setting and the fights are most of the time believable. Zor, the villain, has with is prisoner throughout the film one of the most interesting psychological confrontation that gives tension to the movie, even if Ator seems way too fit for the task to loose. <br /><br />What gives this movie that little extra are those scenes that may look quirky, but worth of mention. The fight with the serpent god, even though he is a gigantic puppet, is well handled as the snake, with good lightnings, remains a silhouette and the fight is quite convincing. The movie climaxes in a most unusual way, quite anachronic, but breathtaking : the deltaplane sequence. The scene itself is not introduced properly, read not at all, where did Ator get that machine, it's pretty unconvincing, but it leads to a really poetic and beautiful midair sequence, that standalone, is the culminating point in the movie, elevating Ator in a place where few human fantasy heroes have been. <br /><br />If Blade Master is not among the great fantastic movies of all time is no surprise due to its lacks, it's a bigger surprise, considering the philosophical way it chooses on the confrontation between good and evil, the truth it speaks and the heart it shows, that this movie is so unwlecomed.

The reviewer praises the film's thought-provoking themes, which transcend its ancient setting, and its exploration of the struggle between good and evil. Ator, the protagonist, is portrayed as a well-rounded character who relies on wit and intelligence in addition to physical strength, making him a more compelling hero than Conan the Barbarian. The reviewer also commends the film's believable fight scenes, impressive settings, and memorable confrontations, such as the psychological battle between Ator and the villain Zor.

The review highlights several standout scenes, including the fight with the serpent god and the breathtaking deltaplane sequence, which, despite some narrative inconsistencies, elevates the film to a poetic and beautiful climax.

18645,"The Ator series is a shining example of what B-movies should be. They fail in every aspect, but in such a hilarious way that they are funny rather than sad. ""Ator l'invincibile 2"" aka ""The Blade Master"" aka ""Cave Dwellers"" shows us Europe's favorite Conan clone, Ator where we left him in the first movie- after showing us a lengthy recap of all the events of the first film. This time the world must be saved from ""The Nucleus"", a kind of bomb, represented on screen as a bright light (I guess they couldn't afford a prop).

18646,"Blademaster is definitely a memorable entry in the Swords and Sorcery category of movies. I found Blademaster along with Quest for the Mighty Sword at a thrift shop attended by mentally handicapped people and was very happy to pay 2.00 each for them. Believable sets and costumes, good sword fighting and a beautiful female warrior, Mila make this an enjoyable watch. A few problems though, there were a lot of details in the plot that didn't quite fit, like the cave men for one. I didn't understand their purpose. Also, this movie could have really benefited from some more monsters. The snake was cool, but I guess it does borrow a little from Conan. However, any primitive sort of movie where someone winds up with a hanglider is OK by me (see Yor and Battle for Endor). I think Ator is cool! Oh, and was anyone else reminded of Gallager by the villain or is it just me?

However, the reviewer also mentions some criticisms, such as plot details that don't quite fit, like the inclusion of cave men, which seem out of place.

It's got a fairy tale quality you rarely get in real life, and it's also got 8 people credited for the script, so they must have been making up stuff right and left.<br /><br />This is a very likable movie that conveys how magical film was to people who had never seen it before. It is not an especially deep movie, touching briefly on the loss of tradition and the encroachment of western culture but mainly just being a pleasant little movie. It's actually a movie I enjoyed very much that is already beginning to disappear from my mind 15 minutes after seeing it. Light as a soufflé, but I enjoyed every minute.",Positive,positive,positive,positive,"This review is generally positive, with the reviewer describing the movie as ""sweet,"" ""likable,"" and ""pleasant.""

18649,Gentle and genial film seems to have been overlooked as a triviality...and to be fair the narrative is a bit tenuous and lightweight as drama....but I feel the simple wonder and joy of the scenes depicting the first impact of a new art on an alien and sceptical society have a radiance and naturalness which capture the century long romance between cinema and audience better than any film in years. Immensely sympathetic performance from Jared Harriss (who seems to have inherited all of his fathers charisma...hopefully without poor Richards penchant for hellraising and haminess)....and charming offbeat cuteness from costar Yu Xia combine to make this a real heartwarmer. Radiant location photography (including glowingly beautiful scenes at the great wall) and sensitive direction by Ann Hu give film added impact.

18650,"This film is about so many things. Most obvious is the hold that film can have over an audience and how capturing life on film can be a kind of magic. There is also the tense relationship between China and the West as many Chinese saw (probably rightly so) the ""Barbarians"" as trying to take over and pollute their way of life. Liu even seeks to preserve their way of life on film because he sees that it will one day disappear.

Captures the amazement of film's first audiences pretty much as it's described to have been worldwide, and uses actual Lumiere films for most of the actualities.

18661,"The slasher sub-genre has been pretty much exhausted - in fact, even by 1979, just one year after the supposed 'first slasher', Halloween (which was released seven years after Bay of Blood), was released; the sub-genre wasn't far from being exhausted; but Tourist Trap represents one of the more original outings. The film follows the same basic formula as most slashers - i.e. madman murders a load of kids, but draws its originality from the fact that madman is shown from the beginning (as opposed to an unseen assailant or a man in a mask) and we actually get some insight into his character. The fact that this killer also has telekinetic abilities, including being able to control the wax dummies that fill his house, adds to the originality. We kick off with a great opening sequence, which sees a young man fall foul of having a flat tire after finding himself in a gas station of terror. The scene is amazingly creepy, as the wax dummies taunt him and things fly from the shelves - and it gives the audience a great insight into what is to come; namely, a very creepy horror film! <br /><br />The acting credibility is as non-existent as you would expect from a seventies slasher, but to be honest; it's not all that bad. The girls look hot, the boys don't really matter; and Chuck Connors is more than adequately creepy in the role of the psycho. He's not exactly Anthony Perkins; but still, good enough. It's not the acting that's the star of the show, however, and as you might expect - the creepy atmosphere takes that prize. Wax models, as proved by the likes of House of Wax (Vincent Price version...) are very creepy; and the film makes best use of that fact. There are very few things in cinema that can be frightening by simply being there - but wax statues are definitely one of those things. The killer's special ability could easy have gotten in the way of the atmosphere, but the film makes best use of this fact, even, by having various things fly off shelves and it goes well with the rest of the movie. On the whole, this is a very good film. While Tourist Trap might not be absolutely essential viewing; it's well worth seeing and I can recommend it.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review of the 1979 horror film ""Tourist Trap"" is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting the film's originality and creepy atmosphere within the slasher sub-genre.

The inclusion of wax dummies as a central element adds to the film's creepiness, which is effectively utilized to create a sense of unease. The reviewer also commends the film's opening sequence, which sets the tone for the rest of the movie.

While the acting is not exceptional, the reviewer notes that it is adequate, with Chuck Connors delivering a suitably creepy performance as the psycho. The reviewer emphasizes that the film's strength lies in its atmosphere, which is effectively created through the use of wax models and the killer's telekinetic abilities.

""Tourist Trap"" isn't like that! If it's typically gruesome slashing you want...than it's typically gruesome slashing you'll get! Plenty of it AND constantly from start to finish!

18666,"One of the oddest, most strikingly eerie and creepy horror films to come out of the 70's, ""Tourist Trap"" even by the loose, free-wheeling, convention-defying ""anything goes"" standards of its time rates as a real weirdie. Yet, it's the picture's very strangeness -- a masterfully mounted uncanny atmosphere of pervasively off-kilter supernatural dread which from the get-go registers as powerfully spooky and becomes more increasingly opaque and frightening as the film progresses, offering up ample shocks amid a few scattered moments of surreally lovely dream-like elegance and ending on a bitterly ironic, crushingly nihilistic note with a haunting final image that's hard to shake -- which makes it such a unique and singularly unnerving experience.<br /><br />Five teenagers traveling through the desolate California desert by car get hopelessly lost. They stumble across ""Slausen's Lost Oasis,"" a seedy, rundown roadside dive that's one part gas station, three parts crummy wax museum, and all parts ratty and foreboding. The joint's lonely, seemingly friendless and harmless owner Slausen (juicily overplayed with infectiously hammy brio by Chuck Conners) turns out to be a deranged psychic killer with lethal telekinetic powers. Slausen brings his freaky assortment of uncomfortably human-like mannequins to life and picks off the kids one by one so he can add them to his ever-growing collection of victims.<br /><br />Director David (""Puppermaster,"" ""The Arrival"") Schmoeller adeptly wrings every last ounce of tension he can squeeze from the pleasingly ambiguous and open-ended script he co-wrote with J. Larry Carroll. (Said script's stubborn refusal to provide some rational excuse for all the bizarre stuff which transpires throughout the movie, often wrongly criticized as one of the film's principal weaknesses, is actually the movie's key strength, giving the picture the scary, anything-and-everything-can-happen, common-logic-be-damned quality of a true nightmare come horrifically to life which never would have been achieved if there was some kind of credible explanation offered for what's happening.) Pino Donaggio's beautifully chilling, understated score, Nicholas von Sternberg's shadowy cinematography, and Robert A. Burns' grubby, cramped production design add immensely to the film's profoundly unsettling mood. Excellent performances are another significant plus, with the pretty, perky Jocelyn Jones (Ellie-Jo Turner in ""The Great Texas Dynamite Chase"") particularly fine and personable as the most resilient and sympathetic of the endangered teens.

Unfortunately for the friends, however, the owner of the roadside attraction possesses the power to control his wax mannequins and use them for evil. One by one, the tourists are stalked down and killed by Slausen and his legion of wax dummies. Can the friends escape or will they fall to the same fate as their lost friend? Following in the footsteps (and twisting them around) of the great classic wax films (House of Wax, Mystery of the Wax Museum), Tourist Trap takes the slasher genre to a whole new level of strange and fascinating with its bizarre story and style. As far as character development, action, dialogue, flow, etc., it seems to be just a basic slasher flick. But, it goes far beyond that as the director takes control of the plot and moves it to the supernatural thriller it is. The acting ranges from acceptable (from the main cast) to very good (from backwoods-showman Mr. Slausen (played by Western-legend Chuck Connors)). The writing moves well and the dialogue is well structured, but there are some flaws in logic as the film moves deeper into the story. Also, some scenes are a bit silly, like the moaning-mannequin attack on Becky. It's nothing, however, that would detract from the effect of the film. As one would expect from a film about wax dummies, it is full of the endless creepiness supplied by the mannequins. It's strange that a (mostly) inanimate object can just sit still and somehow be so unsettling. . . perhaps it's the human likeness, or the blank stare, or the fact that you know it's about to spring an attack. . . whatever it is, the dolls are extremely spooky and that effect is used very well throughout the entirety of the film. As far as slashers go, it's one of the best, and it stands as one of the creepiest films I've ever seen.<br /><br />Obligatory Slasher Elements:<br /><br />- Violence/Gore: The film is full of some cool deaths. The gore isn't excessive, but it's done well and leaves it as being realistic.<br /><br />- Sex/Nudity: There is an extended skinny-dipping scene with the very attractive lead females (though 'very attractive' barely begins to describe the ravishing future-angel Tanya Roberts) but it's all a tease as the girls remain mostly underwater. They do remain scantily clad throughout the film, however.<br /><br />- Cool Killer(s): Creepy is just the beginning of Slausen and his mannequins. One of the best killers in the slasher subgenre.<br /><br />- Scares/Suspense: From the opening scene on, the film maintains a great blend of the creepiness of the mannequins, jump scares from the attacks, and a strong level of suspense in the stranded situation. . . it's all very well done to make for a genuinely scary film.<br /><br />- Mystery: Well, mystery wasn't really the point of the film. . . just the meaning behind all of it is what matters.<br /><br />- Awkward Dance Scene: All these cute girls and not a single dance. Shame.<br /><br />Final verdict: 8/10. See this creepy slasher!<br /><br />-AP3-",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the film ""Tourist Trap"" for its unique blend of slasher and supernatural thriller elements. The reviewer appreciates the film's ability to balance creepiness, suspense, and jump scares, making it a genuinely scary experience. The acting, writing, and direction are all commended, with special mention of Chuck Connors' performance as the sinister Mr. Slausen. The reviewer also highlights the film's effective use of wax mannequins as a source of unease, making them a standout feature of the movie.

While the reviewer notes some minor flaws in logic and a few silly scenes, these are deemed insignificant in the face of the film's overall impact. The obligatory slasher elements, such as violence, sex, and nudity, are also assessed, with the reviewer concluding that the film delivers on these fronts without relying on excessive gore or gratuitous content.

18670,"""Tourist Trap"" is an odd thriller that came out in the 70's, it's about 5 friends Molly (Jocelyn Jones), Jerry (Jon Van Hess), Eileen (Robin Sherwood), Becky (Tanya Roberts) and Woody (Kevin McDermott), who stumble upon a cloesd down museum SLAUSEN'S LOST OASIS, a curious and eerie roadside museum. This goldmine of decaying, but strangely life-like mannequins is run by Slausen (Chuck Conners), an eccentric, but seemingly harmless has-been. Slausen has one warning for the youngsters: Stay away from Davey, Slausen's reclusive and disturbed brother.<br /><br />The youngsters' curiosity gets the best of them and they go exploring. The trap is sprung! Amidst flying objects, slamming doors, scarves that strangle on their own, empowered by some hidden force, the trap slowly closes in on the group. The ""Creature"" Davey and his army of murderous mannequins make quick and brutal work of the friends, until only one remains.<br /><br />Although not a Slasher movie ""Tourist Trap"" still contains elements of slasher movies such as the chase scenes and the stalking and the fact the killer wears a mask.<br /><br />The seemingly telekinetic abilities of the killer to lock bolts and animate the wax dummies, is used to great effect. Perhaps the scariest thing about this movie are the mannequins, which are admittedly scary enough to start off with, but are rally spooky here. The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.

18672,"""Tourist Trap"" is a bizarre, great horror film from the '70s. The film is about a group of young adults, Becky, Jerry, and Molly, who are traveling in a jeep through a desert area. Their two other friends, Eileen and her boyfriend Woody, are in a separate car. When a wheel goes flat, Woody takes it to a nearby gas station - and meets a grisly fate to some bizarre telekinetic mayhem and some creepy mannequins. The friends get tired of waiting for Woody and go to a local ""tourist trap"" mannequin/wax museum. In front of the entrance, the car randomly breaks down, and the girls find an oasis area to go swimming in, where they are approached by Mr. Slausen, who runs the roadside attraction that is now closed down. He takes them up to the old western wax museum, and the girls stay behind while he and Jerry go to fix their car. Eileen, the curious of the two, wanders to an old house nearby, where she also falls to the hands of a mysterious masked killer and a bunch of life like mannequins. After awaiting for Eileen, Becky and Molly go to look for her. That's when the real horror begins, and the telekinetic (can move objects with his mind) masked brother of Mr. Slausen begins to kill off the teens one by one, while controlling his large amount of human-turned mannequins.<br /><br />Sound similar to the 2005 ""House of Wax"" remake? Well, it is. I'd heard of this movie but never seen it when I saw ""House of Wax"", but now I can see the striking similarities the two movie share - ""Tourist Trap"" was obviously a big contributor to the ""House of Wax"" remake. The mannequins in this movie are scary to begin with, some with moving eyeballs, some with no eyes at all, and some with dropping mouths that sing too. The singing was extremely creepy if you ask me, and the mannequins were eerily designed. Mannequins are creepy to begin with, they're so lifelike yet they really aren't. The movie tightly blends elements from ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (the masks the killer uses are similar to those of Leatherface), with a little bit of the original ""House of Wax"", and the telekinetic powers that are displayed in ""Carrie"". The result is quite satisfying. The telekinesis was a nice touch to the movie, it made the killer all the more menacing and inescapable. The masks were terrifying, and the plastering scene was really disturbing.<br /><br />The score for the film was really well done, if not a little overused during some scenes. The acting may not be particularly on key, but it really wasn't that bad. Chuck Connors was really good as the shadowy Mr. Slauston, giving the character a shady but friendly feel. A young Tanya Roberts is also in the film, she's most known for her role on ""Charlie's Angels"" and more recently the sitcom ""That '70s Show"", playing Donna's mother. Robert A. Burns serves as the art director, he did a phenomenal job on the original ""Texas Chainsaw"" and does a good job here as well, creating a cluttered, musty atmosphere to both the rundown museum and the old house filled with mannequins. I found it a little odd that the original rating for the film was PG, it seems a little too scary to have such a tame rating, but the film really isn't too violent.<br /><br />Overall, ""Tourist Trap"" is an eerily unique, fast paced, extremely under-appreciated horror classic. Full Moon gave it a decent 20th anniversary DVD release, the commentary was interesting and the picture was clear and crisp for the most part, better than the video versions. If you enjoy older '70s slasher-horror films, ""Tourist Trap"" is an underrated retro gem. 8/10.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the 1979 horror film ""Tourist Trap"" as a unique, eerie, and underrated classic.

18677,"Like one of the other reviewers (might have been @ Amazon), I was first introduced to Tourist Trap by the beloved, decrepit old WOR-9 in NY, around January 1983. Devil Dog: The Hound of Hell, which I'd been waiting to see since it debuted on Halloween 1978, had just ended, and I thought I'd had my horror fill for the day (quit laughing - that three eyed ""Borgost"" (sp?) monster Ike Eisenmann draws up in his room is scary).<br /><br />For as much as I still enjoy Richard Crenna wearing his made-for-TV horror hat, it was the first 10 minutes of Tourist Trap, following Devil Dog that day, that really left a mark - and months later, it ended up being the first movie I ever taped off TV. WOR used to play this fairly frequently, often as the Saturday afternoon Million Dollar Movie, as others have observed. It's one of those offerings that delivers a powerful horror punch up front, a veritable left hook - and then practically starts over with the rest of the cast, dances and jabs, putting the opening scene a larger context along the way, then moves on to the real climax (see Night of the Living Dead, Re Animator).<br /><br />Two paragraphs and I haven't mentioned a single mannequin. Face it - the damn things are scary enough, without the music and the script. I, too, can remember some scary dress dummies and the like in various relatives' attics and basements, and say what you like about how relatively straightforward Schmoeller and Carroll's approach is - no one, before or since, has played it this well. In real life, a good mannequin will make you do a double take - and here, that's about the last thing you're likely to see, if you happen to be stuck at Slausen's defunct wax museum and roadside stand. Yes, there is a point (""I loved her very much""), where Chuck ""Slausen"" Connors is trying to pass for Vincent Price. Yes, the plot might have taken up all of a paragraph in the early stages; I can't see the script being all that thick. It doesn't matter. From direction to competent acting (Meryl Streep's emphatically not in attendance, and here, that helps instead of hinders), to another useful and effective Pino Dinaggio score (see Carrie and various other de Palma movies), to various lighting, film stock, use of varying sound levels ... I could go on - every element of this low budget production comes together and you get a work very much greater than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />Did I mention it's scary as Hell? Stephen King talked this movie up in Danse Macabre a year or so after its release, and with good reason. Like much of his work, it may not be great art, but it sure does tell a scary story, and does it well. The rest of the cast may be relatively unknown (wasn't Jocelyn Jones in that Texas car chase movie as well?), but Chuck Connors and Tanya Roberts were and are, just familiar enough to audiences, to make you think - Stephen King style - that this could happen to you, or people you know.<br /><br />Comparisons to Psycho (plot) and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (overall look and feel), even if they aren't the first associations in my mind, are valid. I only wish I could comment on the DVD, which I look forward to buying, as Tourist Trap has become notoriously hard to find on video since the near-complete extinction of independent video rental outlets, where it had a home aside from WOR and cable in the 1980s (though TMC/Showtime appear to have picked it up and play it regularly now). No, no spoilers here, I'm afraid, no plot breakdown - go see it yourself (all right, there may be a tiny little one below, so scroll away if you like - better safe than sorry). The mannequins are damn scary and I'd rather show than tell ... :)<br /><br />For the record, Tourist Trap is also chock full of great lines, from ""we are going to have a party! How do I look, huh, how do I look?!"", to ""you're so pretty"", ""you can't hurt me"", ""I shouldn't have to hide it - it feels good!"" (listen for that Vincent Price inflection again there), the inevitable ""you're crazy!"" (delivered at the right moment, and in the right tone) ... and try - just try - to keep the hair on your arms down when you hear the mannequin's head screaming ""Molly!"" - especially once you realize whose head it used to be ... :)<br /><br />P S ... Charles Band was the producer on this, I believe, and likely owned the rights to Dinaggio's music. Band, from what I understand, was the brains behind Full Moon Entertainment, which might explain both the music's subsequent use in Puppet Master, and, well, the 40 commercial approach has characterized Full Moon throughout, from the enjoyable Puppet Master and Subspecies franchises, to, uhhh ... Trancers and Bad Channels (sorry, BOC).",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer expressing their fondness for the 1979 horror film ""Tourist Trap"".

18678,"Some films just fade away, but Tourist Trap has withstood the test of time and has justifiably become a cult favorite.

18679,"This is a bizarre oddity, directed by the guy who edited ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" Chuck Conners gives a hilariously over-the-top performance as the owner of a roadside ""wax"" museum which our doomed teenagers happen to break down near. The wax figures look ""so real,"" one of the teen's points out. Heh, heh, heh...Not so much a slasher film as a weird mix of psychological horror and old fashioned ""House of Wax""-style terror. I can think of many, many horror films that are worse than this one.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is generally positive, albeit with some reservations.

18680,"Let me just start out by saying that Tourist Trap is a better movie then 99.9% of the horror films that have come out of Hollywood lately. If you don't believe me see Darkness Falls or They. And it is certainly better than any of those crappy direct to video releases like Stab, Bleed, The Pool, and so on. One of the big problems with the film Tourist Trap is that is never really found an audience. When the film opened in 1979 it was given a PG rating by the MPAA. Anyone that knows horror films knows that a PG on a horror film is usually the kiss of death for the film. (Director David Schmoeller talks about this problem on the DVD's commentary track.) There are exceptions though like Poltergeist, which had also received a PG rating. However, there are big differences between Tourist Trap and Poltergeist. Tourist Trap was not a big budget Hollywood film like Poltergeist nor was it produced by Steven Spielberg. That alone was enough to guarantee Poltergeist success. (Still for those of you that have seen Tourist Trap, you will even scratch your head as to why the MPAA rated this film PG. The 'heart burst' scene alone should be enough for the film to be slapped with and R rating. Or how about the pipe in the back with the blood running out of it.) I have to admit though that when I was young I looked at a copy of Poltergeist in the video store shelf, picked it up, saw that it was rated PG and put it back on the shelf in favor of an R rated film instead. Years later, I finally saw Poltergeist and realized what a great film I missed out on for not renting a PG horror film. From then on I would never judge a film based on it's rating again. This is most likely what happened to Tourist Trap. People, like me with Poltergeist, will probably overlook it in favor of the R rated film. Most likely it would be a teenager too, which most of these types of films are targeted at. Friday the 13th was no masterpiece either but did extremely well at the box office due to the fact it was rated R and was heavily advertised by Paramount at the time. It found its audience and made enough money to spawn several sequels. When you look at it folks, Tourist Trap is just as good as Friday The 13th. The same thing could've happened to Tourist Trap. We could have seen Tourist Trap 2, 3, 4, and so on. As far as the film goes, Tourist Trap is an entertaining horror film made on an extremely small budget, but it is well acted, well directed and well made on many levels. Chuck Connors is a riot as Mr. Slausen and gives the best performance in the film. Special credit must be give to composer Pino Donaggio, whose score for this film really is what sets it apart from others and gives it its creepiness. The music in the scenes involving the mannequins is especially creepy. Donaggio worked on the horror film Carrie and many other film scores since Tourist Trap. He has done exceptionally good work in film and continues to score films to this day. The weakness with Tourist Trap is that there really is never any explanation of Davey's powers. Maybe that is how it's supposed to be. He just has them, and we should accept that in order for the movie to work. We do accept it to a point, but then the screenplay has incidents like how Davey makes the phone ring in the store while he's in the basement of the house. In that case, is Davey limited in using his powers? Can he make a phone ring in Houston, Detroit, Los Angeles? What is his range? Those are things that people that didn't care for this movie would most likely to point out as flaws. Others would accept it as a mistake. I accept it. There is not enough of those type of questions generated by this film to make me hate it. This is a horror film. We should not be required to read too much into it. Many people have called this the 'killer mannequin' movie. I assure you that no mannequin kills anyone in this film. The mannequins are controlled by the power of Davey who uses them as a weapon. This is a common misconception about this film. Some people have a problem with the mannequins and some have even said they are just downright silly. I think they add to the overall creepiness of the film. Overall Tourist Trap is a good fun rental.***(out of 5)",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer praising ""Tourist Trap"" as a superior horror film compared to many recent Hollywood releases. The reviewer acknowledges that the film's PG rating may have contributed to its lack of success, as it may have been overlooked by audiences seeking more intense, R-rated horror experiences. The reviewer praises the film's acting, direction, and score, particularly highlighting Chuck Connors' performance and Pino Donaggio's creepy score. While the reviewer notes some weaknesses, such as the lack of explanation for Davey's powers, they argue that these flaws do not detract from the film's overall enjoyment.

18682,"After a group of young friends experience car trouble whilst travelling off the beaten track, they accept an offer of help from lonely local Mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors), owner of a nearby museum full of historical wax mannequins. Once at the creepy roadside attraction, the friends are stalked by a mask-wearing lunatic who can bring the museum's dummies to life through the power of the mind.<br /><br />Tourist Trap's bad guy is a demented cross between The Texas Chain Saw Massacre's Leatherface and Anthony, the scary kid from the classic Twilight Zone episode 'It's a Good Life', whilst the plot is a blend of elements from the aforementioned TCM, Hitchcock's Psycho, and House of Wax. The atmosphere and execution of Tourist Trap, however, is so totally off-kilter that, in this respect, it's virtually impossible to draw comparison with other earlier movies.<br /><br />Director David Schmoeller's continually inventive and unpredictable treatment of his own script gives the film a distinctly nightmarish quality, and with a brilliant left-field performance from Connors, an impossibly creepy score from Pino Donaggio, a collection of truly unsettling mannequins with detachable jaws, and the presence of super sexy Tanya Roberts, who spends the film in (and briefly out of) tiny denim hot-pants and a figure hugging boob-tube, Tourist Trap is a totally unforgettable and ultimately one-of-a-kind horror experience well deserving of its cult following.",Positive,positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the film ""Tourist Trap"" for its unique blend of horror elements and its ability to stand out from other films in the genre.

18683,"Perhaps one of the first slasher film that came out after Halloween (Although made from Irwin Yabalans from Halloween), I must say I honestly found ""Tourist Trap"" to be scarier and funner. ""Tourist Trap"" is one of those remarkable treats you find every now and then, and are left with the most enjoyable feeling of surprise. It was destiny I tell you, but one night I was at my local Blockbuster (One or Two months before it went out of business), and had nothing to get. Then I stumble upon this movie, I think huh seems like a laughable B-Movie, I rent it and took it home, boy was I in for a good scare. ""Tourist Trap"" comes off as a bad movie, it definitely has it's cheesy moments,but in the end you're having to much fun with it to really care.<br /><br />The things that impressed me the absolute most, and the things that made this movie one of the scariest ones I've seen, is number one the setting. A horror movie without a good setting isn't very fun, not here. I just love love love the location, it feels like we can relate to it, it almost feels like we've been there before. Which makes it creepier. Next is the characters, non of them are really stereotypical, and they all have a real personality. For example they're not stoners, alcoholics, or even Sex obsessed people, they feel like normal young adults. Plus they look realistic enough, and then their is Chuck Connors. Who gives a great performance as Mr. Slausen who we all take an instant liking too because again he's so real, he feels like that nice guy grandfatherly figure we adore. The last, and probably most important thing that makes this movie scary is how they make us (the audience) jump half way out of our seats, and turn on the rights, for the right reasons. For example most of the time in horror films we mainly just jump because of a sudden change in the music pitch, but in ""Tourist Trap"" prepare yourself, that's not the case. With it's perfect use of lighting, mannequins, and weirdness you feel utterly creeped out. Plus I love because although they may go a bit over-the-top with some things you still feel like this could happen. Which is exactly what a horror movie who takes such a ridicules premise should do, and that is make us (the audience) feel unsafe and terrified.<br /><br />Overall as far as any major problems go, I have none, only that it's weirdness may get a little too weird at times. However in the end ""Tourist Trap"" holds a place near and dear to my heart, for being one of the few horror films to make me turn on the lights and feel unsafe about traveling.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer expressing their surprise and delight at discovering the 1979 horror film ""Tourist Trap"".

The reviewer highlights several aspects of the film that contributed to its effectiveness, including the setting, characters, and scares. They praise the film's use of a relatable and creepy setting, well-developed and realistic characters, and the performance of Chuck Connors as Mr. Slausen. The reviewer also commends the film's ability to create genuine jump scares that are not reliant on cheap tricks, but rather on clever use of lighting, mannequins, and atmosphere.

The only minor criticism mentioned is that the film's weirdness may be too much at times, but this is not enough to detract from the reviewer's overall enthusiasm for the film.

18685,"""Tourist Trap"" is among my favorite late 70's/early 80's horror flicks. A group of young people are heading somewhere, one pair in the car ahead, & that car has a flat, and our film opens with the young man, Woody, pushing the tire along looking for a service station. He finds a seemingly abandoned place, and yet hears voices and investigates, and ends up with a piece of pipe through his stomach for his efforts. Along comes the rest of the young folks (in a VW Thing) and they pick up Woody's girlfriend, and find this very same place, Slausen's Oasis, or some such thing..and then Mr. Slausen happens along while the girls are enjoying a dip in the stream. Of course, the VW Thing has mysteriously died at that point, so odd Mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors) offers his help. Mr. Slausen has a museum, with lots of wax figures, and he lives in the museum but behind is a big house, where he says Davey lives. And who is Davey? Why, Davey Crockett, he says...but if it were Davey Crockett, they'd all probably be safer. The girls are left alone while Slausen goes to help with fixing the car, but of course curiosity gets the better of one & she goes to investigate, and finds the house full of creepy mannequins and one rather animated one named...Davey. What follows is a rather creepy night of terror as one by one, they're taken prisoner by Davey, who says he's Slausen's brother. One girl (kidnapped earlier) is treated to a plaster facial, which results in her death when it covers up her air supply. At any rate there's somewhat of a twist to this and kind (but weird) Mr. Slausen is not exactly what he appears to be. A good, creepy late 70's horror flick, and lots of mannequins make for a very creepy atmosphere. 7 out of 10.",Positive,Positive,Positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer expressing their fondness for the 1979 horror film ""Tourist Trap"".

18686,"A group of young adults get stranded in the back of the beyond, where the only place in the vicinity is a museum full of wax dummies, and the only form of help is affable local Mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors). As night falls, the kids get picked off in record time.<br /><br />An odd, freaky B movie that combines the creepiness of backwoods settings with the plot device of all-too-lifelike mannequins (making this a good update of the ""bodies in the wax museum"" genre), this is an intense shock fest along the lines of ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"". (It should then come as no surprise that TCSM art director Robert A. Burns repeats that duty here, and his eye for great set decoration always comes in handy.) Pino Donaggios' score is downright chilling; accompanied by the murky photography of Nicholas von Sternberg, it drenches the film in oppressive atmosphere.<br /><br />Plot twists vary in level of success; there was one that I saw coming a mile away, and one that actually took me by surprise, and I was all the more happier for it. One of the best moments is shared with us almost right up front, as the first chump victim is trapped in a room with objects flying at him of their own volition. The capper is a great impalement by pipe with blood dripping out of the end.<br /><br />Star Connors offers an engaging performance as our down-home good ol' boy antagonist, while the younger co-stars, predictably, can't perform at the same level, although Jocelyn Jones is a likable enough and certainly winsome lady who has enough appeal to rate as a sympathetic damsel-in-distress. Co-star Tanya Roberts (a brunette in this film) is okay in support. (If I had one problem with this film, it's just that the victims are a little too stupid. Then again, that doesn't make this much different from many horror films of the 80's.) Future notable names among the credits are future directors Ted Nicolaou, who was the editor here, Ron Underwood (who made a great debut almost a dozen years later with ""Tremors"") as the assistant director, and veteran makeup artist Ve Neill, who's done many films and won three Oscars since.<br /><br />Although some horror fans may be disappointed by the lack of nudity and sexual elements, this is otherwise a nice little surprise that debuting director David Schmoeller delivers with conviction and gusto.

18687,"A group of friends break down in the middle of nowhere (one had a flat tire, the other's Jeep mysteriously won't start). One of them takes the tire to a run down service station and that is the last anyone sees of him. When the remaining foursome go in search of their friend, they come across nice Mr. Slaussen who offers to help fix the jeep and offers cool drinks and refuge from the heat in his equally run down, hermit-like house, which happens to be occupied by very realistic looking mannequins. He goes with the one guy in the bunch out to work on the car and leaves the 3 girls in the house. Before he goes he warns them not to leave and go up to the house behind his shack; he warns them about ""Davy"", his brother who is lurking about and isn't all there. Of course, one of them decides to venture out in search of a working phone and is never seen again. Is it Slaussen? Is it Davy? The mannequins?? Tourist Trap has the usual horror requirements (jiggly big boobed girl, goody two shoes girl, curiosity getting the better of people and never working out!), but it stands apart from the rest of the 70's genre in it's twist of an ending. I started to feel sorry for Slaussen (Chuck Conners is a terrific, creepy, over-the-top performance)at a point in the film, and you almost see the character of Molly doing the same. This is a gem if you can find it; I had taped it off of cable when I was younger, and walking through a used video store I spotted a VHS copy that was totally overpriced, but well worth it.

18691,"I suppose it depends on when one actually sees the movie for the first time that their impression is formed the way it is.<br /><br />I saw it as a child on TV back in 1973, when it was ""The Stranger"" and I loved it. Such was the time when the space program to the moon was a reality, when shows like ""Search"", ""UFO"", and ""6M$ Man"" were showing a child of 12 of what the world could hold in their future. Adventure and technology.<br /><br />You got to see shows only once and that was when the network aired them. The only way people could slash your shows was by making their own parody of it; they didn't get to take your show and add in their own comments over it.<br /><br />I did not know what this concept of a ""pilot"" was. I saw the movie and was hoping thru out that Stryker would get home; did not know that there was a possibility of it continuing beyond two hours.<br /><br />Back then, would I understood what so many people hate about the movie now? I doubt it because I don't remember it as such. Do I understand now? Not really for to understand the story, one must not see it from their perspective but rather from that of the characters in the movie.<br /><br />If one is watching as an American, it might be humorous about the lack of security in a police state.....but if one is a subject in that state, then compliance could be expected and security can be less. When things are suppose to be perfect, perfect to an extreme degree, perfect that one is not suppose to doubt, then one is not likely to question as quickly when things are out of order.<br /><br />The subplots of the movie are interesting such as the old man who remembers the time before but watches his words since he suspects that there are spies everywhere. Or that the police state values knowledge to some extent for they are careful about how they control or harm their brain power.<br /><br />These days, one is likely to know exactly what the movie is about before they see it, so much of the suspense, surprise is lost. But the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the Cold War and the astronaut's biggest fear is that he has crashed in the USSR. One gets quite a distance into the movie before it becomes apparent that such a possibility is the least of his concerns.<br /><br />This is the primary difference between ""The Stranger"" and ""Doppelganger"". The latter can be considered timeless since any comments it has about the USSR are comparatively minor and lost early on in the movie. In the former, those links are through out the movie, supposedly directly in the beginning and then as a theme variation after wards.<br /><br />All that said, despite my fond memory for the movie, it is rather easy to see that it would not have made it as a series. Each week, Stryker would make friends, Benedict would chase, Stryker would get away. Eventually, Benedict's society would get rid of him. Someone else would pick up the chase. A rut would develop. There might be a jab at something new such as perhaps another crew member from Stryker's mission showing up, but it probably would not be enough to keep the show going.<br /><br />If one goes in with the knives that others have used to slash the movie, odds are they will slash it as well. But if one remembers that this was made during the Cold War and what fears and estimations of the other side were during that time, of what the popular environment contained for the viewer, then they may find some entertaining and intellectual themes in it.",Positive,Positive,Positive,positive,"This review is a nostalgic and introspective reflection on the film ""The Stranger"" (also known as ""Doppelganger""), which the reviewer first saw as a child in 1973. The reviewer's initial impression of the film was shaped by the context of the time, with the space program and futuristic TV shows like ""Search"" and ""UFO"" influencing their perception of the movie.

The reviewer highlights the film's exploration of a police state, the value of knowledge, and the fear of the unknown, which were particularly relevant during the Cold War era. They also appreciate the suspenseful and surprising elements of the film, which might be lost on modern viewers who are familiar with the plot beforehand. The reviewer acknowledges the film's limitations, particularly in terms of its potential as a series, but argues that it remains an entertaining and thought-provoking film when viewed in its historical context.

The tone of the review is largely positive and nostalgic, with the reviewer encouraging readers to approach the film with an open mind and an understanding of its historical context.

18702,"Let's get this out of the way, so the ones checking out this page looking for info on anything related to the word ""Breasts"" (and you know who you are, googlers) can move along: this is not in any way pornographic. On the contrary, if this has any value as masturbation material then, frankly, the filmmaker didn't do a good job since the aim is to keep it on subject and on the experiences of women and their bodies and images of themselves and society and health and so on. Indeed, I would be a little circumspect of one who came across this on DVD or, if it ever plays again, late night on HBO or Cinemax and used it as a means for pleasure. You might as well go to the supermarket and pick up a pair of ripe melons and take them home and squeeze them and uh, well, you get the idea.<br /><br />No, this is semi-serious film-making meant for premium late-night viewing, but it shouldn't have to be just for the late-night types. This is intimate in setting but not in tone. All of the women, in all their variety of shapes and sizes, and races, and even with one man thrown in with fake breasts, have something of value to say, from life experience in the most straightforward way. If I say semi-serious it's due to the several little segments that the director feels she needs to throw in, with the archival footage of old ""how-to"" videos about puberty and sex and breasts and super-rare cartoons with the knockers flying about. This isn't a problem but an asset: we need a few little visual seg-ways to go between these interviews.<br /><br />Nothing is held back, and we see it as feminism in a liberating form: they don't need to cover up, and even if they choose not to take their tops and shirts and bras off they're still open as can be about a natural part of their body that is an object of sex, surprise, comfort, discomfort, curiosity, motherhood, and, sadly, cancer. In that last part, there's another brave step taken as we see a woman who survived her cancer with only one breast. You know you've become mature and an adult when you can see this woman who has somehow gone on to live a semi-normal life with one breast (the most bittersweet moment is when she says if a fairy godmother said she could have one wish to have two full breasts she would have to think about it), and you don't snicker or go ""eww, gross."" That's the test, folks.<br /><br />It's not shot under the best of circumstances, but then again for TV it's edited with a tight pace. It's never dull for a moment, and we never feel like anyone is holding back, especially when a man might hear the hard truth like that breasts may not really be erogenous, or that a flat chest is very attractive to some men. Breasts: A Documentary is about deconstructing myths with real faces and breasts and minds and hearts laid bare. If that's worthy of a ""I was alone"" session, then, well, more power to you, I guess, though it's not the intention.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the documentary ""Breasts: A Documentary"" for its intimate, liberating, and semi-serious approach to exploring women's experiences with their bodies, particularly their breasts.

The inclusion of diverse women, including one who has survived cancer and has only one breast, adds to the documentary's emotional impact and thought-provoking nature.

18704,"When I first saw Colleen Moore it was in the excellent series about silent films called ""Hollywood"". There she was in 1980, her hair defiantly bobbed as it was in the Twenties, a sparkling, witty and charismatic elderly lady - the very definition of ""presence"". Then I saw her fabulous silent comedy work in films like ""Ella Cinders"" and ""Orchids and Ermine"". Then the disappointingly sombre talkie ""The Scarlet Letter"". And now here she is in ""The Power and the Glory"" giving a performance of staggering power, working expertly alongside one of the talking cinema's finest actors - Spencer Tracy.<br /><br />I found the movie a little lack lustre story-wise, but Moore and Tracy give such brilliant performances that the story hardly seems to matter. Both actors age from youth to old age in the course of the film - and this is done mostly through acting alone with minimal make-up and hair changes. Moore is almost unrecognisable as the elderly wife, and the scene where she finds out her husband is seeing a younger woman is one of the most magnificently performed scenes I have ever seen. She does most of the scene without dialogue, which is where her silent acting experience gives her the edge, even over Tracy. Contrast this with her delightful comic playing in another silent sequence when she is a young woman and Tracy is struggling to propose to her. Astonishing! What this film reveals more than anything else is how shameful it is that Hollywood let this remarkable actress slip through its fingers and spend most of her life in retirement.",Positive,Positive,Positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer expressing admiration for Colleen Moore's exceptional performance in ""The Power and the Glory"". The reviewer's enthusiasm is evident in their description of Moore as ""sparkling, witty, and charismatic"" and praises her ""staggering power"" in the film. The reviewer highlights Moore's impressive range, noting her ability to convincingly portray a character from youth to old age, with minimal makeup and hair changes. The scene where Moore's character discovers her husband's infidelity is singled out as a standout, with the reviewer marveling at Moore's ability to convey emotion without dialogue, a testament to her silent film experience.

While the reviewer finds the story somewhat lacking, they emphasize that the performances of Moore and Spencer Tracy more than make up for it. The reviewer's tone is one of reverence, not only for Moore's talent but also for the injustice of her being overlooked by Hollywood, leading to her early retirement. The review concludes by lamenting the loss of this remarkable actress, implying that her talent was wasted.

18705,"The story of Tom Garner opens with his grand funeral and is told through a series of elegant flashbacks narrated by his faithful lifetime friend Henry. Henry and his wife debate whether Tom was a great man and a genius or an utterly worthless scoundrel. The film is beautifully written, acted and directed, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Tom was the fabulously rich and successful owner of a large railroad, dominating his board of directors and his competition, terrorizing his employees, slaughtering strikers. Tom's ambitious wife Sally was responsible for all of Tom's success. When he met her, he was illiterate and entirely content with his work as a trackwalker for the railroad. Sally teaches him to read and takes over his trackwalker job while Tom goes to school. He starts to rise one step at a time through the railroad hierarchy until he eventually takes over as president.<br /><br />But as Tom becomes a business tycoon, his marriage to Sally gradually falls to pieces. His spoiled son despises him, and he takes up with a much younger woman (the aptly named Eve), with predictably catastrophic consequences. In his business life, Tom is a total success; in his personal life, a disastrous failure. Much like the Hearst figure in ""Citizen Kane,"" Tom symbolizes the best and the worst of the capitalist system.<br /><br />Spencer Tracy is terrific in the role of Tom Garner and the business scenes ring with authenticity. Colleen Moore is also excellent as Sally; both of them age beautifully in the multi-generational story. The film was written by Preston Sturges, but is nothing like the screwball comedies for which Sturges became famous.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the film's writing, acting, and direction.

The reviewer highlights the strong performances of Spencer Tracy as Tom and Colleen Moore as his wife Sally, noting that they both age convincingly throughout the multi-generational story.

The reviewer also appreciates the film's nuanced portrayal of Tom's character, who embodies both the best and worst aspects of capitalism. The film's exploration of Tom's personal life, including his troubled marriage and disastrous affair, adds depth to the narrative. The reviewer draws a comparison to ""Citizen Kane,"" suggesting that Tom's character serves as a symbol of the capitalist system's contradictions.

18706,"Preston Sturgis' THE POWER AND THE GLORY was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late 1990s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television. In the meantime it had gained in notoriety because Pauline Kael's THE CITIZEN KANE BOOK had suggested that the Herman Mankiewicz - Orson Welles screenplay for KANE was based on Sturgis' screenplay here. As is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the IMDb web site, Kael overstated her case.<br /><br />There are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of Charles Foster Kane: the newsreel (representing Ralston - the Henry Luce clone), Thatcher's memoirs, Bernstein, Jed Leland, Susan Alexander Kane, and Raymond the butler. Each has his or her different slant on Kane, reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man. And of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of Kane's story. This method also leads to frequent overlapping re-tellings of the same incident.<br /><br />This is not the situation in THE POWER AND THE GLORY. Yes, like KANE it is about a legendary business leader - here it is Tom Garner (Spencer Tracy), a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country. But there are only two narrators - they are Garner's right hand man Henry (Ralph Morgan) and his wife (Sarah Padden). This restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of Kane in Garner. Henry, when he narrates, is talking about his boss and friend, whom he respected and loved. His wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she sees only the flaws in Henry.<br /><br />Typical example: Although he worked his way up, Tom becomes more and more anti-labor in his later years. Unions are troublemakers, and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans. Henry describes Tom's confrontation with the Union in a major walk-out, and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life. But Henry's wife reminds him how Tom used scabs and violence to end the strike (apparently blowing up the Union's headquarters - killing many people). So we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black.<br /><br />I'm not really knocking THE POWER AND THE GLORY for not duplicating KANE's success (few films do - including all of Orson Welles' other films), but I am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold one's interest to the end. And thanks to the performances of Tracy and Colleen Moore as his wife Sally, the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home.<br /><br />When they marry, Tom wants to do well (in part) to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had. But in America great business success comes at a cost. Tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire (he expands it and improves it constantly). But it takes him away from home too much, and he loses touch with Sally. And he also notices Eve (Helen Vinson), the younger woman who becomes his mistress.

No CITIZEN KANE perhaps, but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in Depression America.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review provides a thoughtful analysis of Preston Sturges' ""The Power and the Glory,"" comparing it to Orson Welles' ""Citizen Kane.""

18708,"Despite later claims, this early-talkie melodrama has very little in common with ""Citizen Kane"": It's a biopic of a ruthless but human fictional plutocrat, told in flashback but hopping around time. The scriptwriter, Preston Sturges, shows none of his later gift for sparkling dialog, and none of the myriad cinematic innovations of ""Kane"" are evident. Still, it's very watchable, with a young Spencer Tracy (his old-man makeup makes him look just like, well, an old Spencer Tracy) showing depth and authority, and Colleen Moore -- a little past her prime, and not physically well matched -- playing a multifaceted woman-behind-the-man. There's also Helen Vinson as one of the most treacherous femmes fatales in movie history, sending the final third into ecstatic soap-opera reverberations. The surviving print is jumpy and has missing audio snippets, and there are some plot holes left open (how would she know whose son it was if she's sleeping with both of them?), and the music is awfully hokey. For all that, I was quite fascinated.",Positive,Positive,Positive,positive,"This review provides a mixed assessment of the film, acknowledging both its shortcomings and redeeming qualities. The reviewer notes that the film lacks the cinematic innovations and sparkling dialogue that Preston Sturges would later become known for, and that it bears little resemblance to ""Citizen Kane"" despite later claims. The reviewer also points out some technical issues with the surviving print, including jumpiness and missing audio snippets, as well as some plot holes.

However, the reviewer also finds the film to be ""very watchable"" and praises the performances of the lead actors, particularly Spencer Tracy, who shows ""depth and authority"" in his portrayal of the ruthless plutocrat. The reviewer also appreciates the multifaceted character of the woman-behind-the-man, played by Colleen Moore, and the treacherous femme fatale, played by Helen Vinson, who adds to the film's soap-opera-like drama.

18710,"This is an extremely involving series that is well casted and portraits a sensitive subject with great splendor.

The series is very well written, and has enough plot twists to keep you sitting at the edge of your seat waiting for whatever happens next.<br /><br />Michael Ealy is by my definition one of the best actors I've seen portraying an undercover agent. Icey cold on the outside, but still a good human being underneath trying his best to keep his head afloat in a highly emotional roller-coaster ride that FBI has had him embark on. Oder Fehr on the other hand comes off a guy that pretty much could fit into any social scenario. Big and strong, but yet able to disappear into the gray mass if so needed. Highly authoritative and extremely cunning. The way the two communicate on screen is nothing short of spectacular.<br /><br />The way the story develops, and the level of detail that the script offers makes the whole story extremely believable, and also very true to life I would imagine. It is of such magnitude that you're left with the feeling of being insecure, not knowing what might happen next in real life. We read about terror every day, and here we are given a good sneak peak into an underworld which most of us know very little about.<br /><br />It's a series that will for sure have you coming back for more, sitting there at the edge of your seat just waiting for next weeks episode to come on.

18711,"I watched Sleeper Cell with a bit of trepidation worrying over whether the terrorists would be glorified. This mesmerizing series not only handled the subject matter responsibly, it created depth and substance to almost every character. Oded Fehr just gobbles up the screen in every scene he's inand even though his character is the charismatic leader of a jihad terrorist cell, he still has hypnotic appeal. Michael Ealy held his own well, though in some scenes I wondered why he wasn't shot on the spot because of the scowl he wore on his face.<br /><br />The pros of the series are the two leads, Fehr and Ealy, the well written characters--all of which were believable and tragic, and the disconcerting issues addressed in the story. Having been married to a Muslim myself, the atmosphere created was quite realistic. The cons, for me personally, were that the female T&A was overkillmost seemed gratuitous, as well as some of the sex scenes. Despite that, it is a raw gripping series that will make you think. Somebody give Fehr more juicy roles like this one and let him run with it. He's got incredible screen presence and a strange kind of innate power emanating off him.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review of the TV series ""Sleeper Cell"" is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer praising the show's responsible handling of sensitive subject matter, well-developed characters, and strong performances from the leads, particularly Oded Fehr.

The reviewer appreciates the show's ability to create believable and tragic characters, as well as its thought-provoking exploration of disconcerting issues. The reviewer's personal connection to the Muslim community adds credibility to their assessment of the show's realistic portrayal of the atmosphere.

18713,"I enjoyed this series, but felt that the whole thing was let down by the sound recording/mixing.<br /><br />For whatever reason, they've had to employ an awful lot of what's called ADR, where the actors replace the original location sound with a re-recording of it in a sound booth.<br /><br />The reasons for doing this are usually due to problems at the location, or because somebody screwed up somewhere in the sound production chain.<br /><br />It wouldn't be so bad if the ADR was done well, but at times it's just plain distracting.

18715,"Sleeper Cell is what 24 should have been. 24 is a cartoon. (I watch 24 but feel cheated with every stupid episode, all four or five seasons so far. Who can keep track as they are all the same. Jack gets in trouble, Jack gets out of trouble and then immediately gets back in to trouble and then...) Sleeper Cell is really well done and is far superior. Unfortunately they blew it with the ending in season two. I can think of a half dozen better endings off the top of my head that would have worked better for the writer's obvious goals and not been so contrived.

18716,"*BE WARNED OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS*<br /><br />A friend told me to check out this series, and I'm glad I took her words for it.<br /><br />I read the synopsis on the DVD cover and I was immediately intrigued. The main protagonist is Muslim? No way, this is a first! It's about an FBI agent who is under deep cover to penetrate a possible sleeper cell in LA; and get this - he is a practicing Muslim. I was a little skeptical at first, half-expecting some hero or the antagonist to spout maybe silly, gratuitous and mindless holier-than-thou fanatic drivels... let's face it, a lot of shows have been guilty of this.<br /><br />But then I watched the first three episodes, and I thought: Okay, this is good. It wasn't until episode four (""Scholar"") when I was well and truly impressed. I would like to commend on the great writing and also, superb performances from the actors. I just love how complex every one of these characters - they're not straight out two-dimensional cardboard cutout good guys/bad guys. Michael Ealy gives a wonderful and believable performance as the Muslim FBI agent Darwyn Al-Sayeed, treading the fine line between being the good Muslim and being a man with flaws. Oded Fehr gives his character Farik an interesting depth - Farik is not the typical oily Middle Eastern stereotype, but simply someone who truly believes in his cause and doesn't see himself as a fanatic but a man willing to do whatever extreme measures to justify his beliefs. He's very charismatic and authoritative. But I would say that it was Alex Nesic's performance that clearly left an impression in me in ""Scholar"". His portrayal of his character's emotional struggle was amazing - torn between the softly spoken words of a Muslim scholar encouraging him to return to the non-aggressive way because it is the only acceptable way in God's eye and Farik's persuasion to believe otherwise.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to watch more shows like this, and not some ridiculously high-octane one man show series.

18717,"I'm not sure how this could have been better, so I gave it a 10. The acting was excellent - the main woman was so HOT - the chap who played Darwyn was a smouldering, pensive character who showed the inner turmoil he was suffering (the truck driver's death is one example)excellently. The storyline was believable and the series length was just about right (i.e. I love Lost, but will it ever end?). As a Brit i tend to think of Yanks as gung ho. The LAPD were in their ill advised attempts to arrest him, but the other agencies were portrayed positively.

18725,"To be completely honest, I completely intrigued by the original concept of 'Sleeper Cell.' Having watched the best part of the series on FX Channel (UK), my Sky got broke meaning I missed the crucial finale.

18726,"Sleeper Cell attempts to swim both sides of the pool (terrorism/patriotic Muslim Americans), and it does neither very well.<br /><br />I had put off watching this show for a very long time, because I had a feeling it would be too predictable, but after a year in my netflix queue, I finally moved it up to the front.<br /><br />The show is about an undercover Muslim man working for the FBI in an attempt to infiltrate a terrorist cell operating in the United States. The undercover agent in the show actually is a Muslim, so we see his conflict/resolution between his Patriotism and his Religious beliefs. Personally I would have rather watched a drama about a Muslin American family living in the United States, but it is doubtful that an America TV channel (cable or network) will ever produce anything that shows Muslims in a flattering light.<br /><br />I am not a Muslim, but I have a lot of Muslim American Friends, and I can honestly say that none of them are terrorists and they all love America.<br /><br />Sleeper Cell comes close to busting stereotypes of Muslims, but it also focuses on the worse Muslim stereotypes. In the first episode we see an ""honor killing,"" which is a very poor portrayal of Islam, but in the 3rd episode we see a very respected moderate Muslim scholar teaching the viewer that the real Jihad is actually a personal struggle that is not meant to incite violence towards others.<br /><br />If only the Moderate Muslim scholar had been the main character of the show.<br /><br />Americans need to learn a lot more about Islam, Sleeper Cell helps a little bit, but it comes up far short of giving the America audience what it really needs to knows.<br /><br />That said, the acting in this show is superb, and the drama is extremely engrossing. If only they had made this show about Islam in America without the terrorism, it would have been first rate.",Positive,Negative,Negative,mixed,"This review of the TV show ""Sleeper Cell"" is mixed, but ultimately leans towards a negative assessment. The reviewer expresses disappointment that the show fails to effectively balance its portrayal of terrorism and patriotic Muslim Americans, instead perpetuating stereotypes and reinforcing negative perceptions of Islam. The reviewer criticizes the show's reliance on sensationalist plot points, such as the ""honor killing"" in the first episode, which they argue misrepresents Islam. While they acknowledge some positive aspects, such as the nuanced portrayal of a moderate Muslim scholar, they lament that this character is not the main focus of the show.

The reviewer's personal connection to Muslim American friends and their desire to see a more accurate representation of Islam in media is evident throughout the review. They express frustration that the show does not provide a more comprehensive understanding of Islam, instead perpetuating stereotypes and reinforcing negative perceptions. The reviewer praises the acting and drama, but ultimately concludes that the show falls short of its potential, particularly in its failure to provide a more nuanced portrayal of Islam in America.

18727,"<br /><br />There is something about seeing a movie in a good, old-fashioned movie house that adds enormous appeal to every picture. I, fortunately enough, was able to see at Film Forum in New York City a pair of Ernst Lubitsch comedies during their three week tribute to the legendary director. The double feature I attended was a screening of Lubitsch's 1938 comedy Bluebeard's Eighth Wife and the pre-Code classic Design for Living, neither of which I had seen before. Everything I read of Design for Living praised the film, but I could not find a good review anywhere for Bluebeard's Eighth Wife. Leonard Maltin disliked it.VideoHound, too, gave the comedy a low rating.its IMDB score was not complimentary.and Pauline Kael (not a great surprise) blasted the film in her scathing review. So, when I went into the city that day I was expecting to enjoy Bluebeard's Eighth Wife only slightly and love Design for Living completely. Bluebeard's Eighth Wife (which was showing first) began, as the eccentrics who populate the cinema took their seats and the thirties music subsided. `Adolph Zukor presents Claudette Colbert and Gary Cooper in Ernst Lubitsch's Bluebeard's Eighth Wife,' the title card read. Then the picture opened with a hilarious scene: Cooper wants to buy a pair of pajama tops, but he doesn't want any part of the bottoms! He gets into a squabble with the clerk, who seeks the help of his higher bosses, and their seems to be no end to the argument. Enter Claudette Colbert, one of thirties cinema's most beautiful, charming, and talented personalities. `I'll take the bottom,' she kindly intercedes. And there you have perhaps screwball comedies finest `meet cute' ever. The film kept my interest wonderfully.I found myself laughing almost constantly. When Colbert discovers, just before a family portrait is taken, that her groom-to-be has been married seven times, the entire theatre broke into histerics. When she bargains for money immediately after she gets over her shock, the laughs (which still haven't ceased) intensify. And Edward Everett Horton milked some hilarious reactions out of the script as well. When Cooper takes inspiration from Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew in disciplining his wife by slapping her in the face, I could not control my laughter when she slapped him back. And the drunk scene with the scallions is one of Claudette Colbert's funniest comic scenes. The greatest comic moment of the film came when Colbert highers a boxer to `teach her husband a lesson.' In pure screwball fashion, he knocks out the wrong man, instead putting her friend David Niven into a cold sleep. He awakes as Cooper is arriving. In order to cover up the situation, Colbert herself, in a moment of strong sexiness, puts her fist up to Niven, asks: `Where did that man hit you? Here? Right here? Right here?' and then BAM! knocks him out again! The film was wonderful, from beginning to end it was a perfect delight. I loved Design for Living, too, though I dare say I think for sheer laughs and entertainment Bluebeard's Eighth Wife was the better and more enjoyable film. There is some charm of seeing a vintage film on the large screen. And in the presence of others laughing, one feels more comfortable doing so himself. That is, perhaps, why I felt the way I did about Bluebeard's Eighth Wife.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer expressing their delight and surprise at enjoying Ernst Lubitsch's 1938 comedy ""Bluebeard's Eighth Wife"" despite low expectations due to negative reviews from critics like Leonard Maltin and Pauline Kael. The reviewer praises the film's comedic scenes, particularly the ""meet cute"" between Claudette Colbert and Gary Cooper, and highlights several hilarious moments, including a slapstick scene where Colbert's character slaps Cooper's character back after he disciplines her. The reviewer also appreciates the performances of the supporting cast, including Edward Everett Horton.

18728,"For some perverse reason best known to themselves these IMDb boards seem reluctant to credit the great Billy Wilder as co-scriptwriter on at least two (this one and Ninotchka) of his early classics when any buff can detect the Wilder hand at work. As it happens this represented the first time he was teamed with Charles Brackett (who DOES get a credit) and it was a great start. One commenter has noted how satisfying it is to see these type of films in old-fashioned cinemas and I couldn't agree more. In Paris one of the smaller Revival houses shows in one of its salles a more or less continuous Lubitsch retrospective and I'm pleased to report that this played to a very appreciative audience right across the age spectrum though I doubt whether any were actually alive when it was first released in 1938. The famous Wilder schtick the meet-cute is particularly tasty here when millionaire but-careful-with-it Cooper attempts to buy half a set of pajamas in a department store on the Riviera and meets with sales resistance until Claudette Colbert turns up and agrees to buy the other half. The gag is milked even more when, having exhausted the chain of command at the store itself the manager places a call to the owner, who is in bed and leaves it to reveal that he, too, is only wearing the top half of pajamas. The film is full of sight-gags like this balanced with verbal wit which makes it just about perfect. Claudette Colbert is only terrific and gets great backing from Edward Everett Horton as her impoverished titled father. David Niven in fourth billing has some funny 'business' as does Franklin Pangborn and if Gary Cooper is not up to his role lacking as he does the verbal dexterity and sophisticated persona that Wilder scripts called for at this stage of his career well, you can't have everything and what you DO have is darned near perfect.",Positive,positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer expressing admiration for the film's clever script, witty dialogue, and comedic performances. The reviewer notes that the film's success is due in part to the collaboration between Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett, and praises the film's ability to balance physical comedy with verbal wit. The reviewer also highlights the strong performances of the cast, particularly Claudette Colbert, Edward Everett Horton, and David Niven, although they note that Gary Cooper may not have been the best fit for his role.

The reviewer's tone is enthusiastic and celebratory, with phrases such as ""just about perfect"" and ""darned near perfect"" emphasizing their high opinion of the film. The reviewer also shares a personal anecdote about watching the film in a revival house in Paris, which adds to the sense of nostalgia and appreciation for the film.

18729,"Years before pre-nuptial agreements became a regular thing, Ernest Lubitsch made a screen comedy on which they are the basis. Bluebeard's Eighth Wife involves Gary Cooper as a multi-millionaire living on the French Riviera who's been married seven times and now marries Claudette Colbert for number eight. But Cooper's a good sport about it, he always settles with his ex-wives for a $50,000.00 a year as per an agreement they sign before marrying him. Sounds like what we now call a pre-nuptial agreement.<br /><br />Of course Claudette wants a lot more than that and she feels Cooper takes an entirely too business like approach to marriage. She'd like the real deal and is willing to go some considerable lengths to get it.<br /><br />Bluebeard's Eighth Wife has some really funny moments, the original meeting of Cooper and Colbert in a men's store where Cooper is insisting he wants only pajama tops and Colbert looking for only bottoms. And of course my favorite is Colbert trailing and blackmailing the detective Cooper sends to spy on her. Herman Bing has the best supporting role in the film as that selfsame, flustered detective.<br /><br />I've often wondered how back in the day Hollywood could get away with casting so many people who are non-French in a film like this. Of course Cooper is an American and Colbert of the cast is the only one actually of French background. Though David Niven is charming as always, having him be a Frenchman is ludicrous, he is sooooooo British.<br /><br />Nevertheless Bluebeard's Eighth Wife is an enjoyable film and a great example of what was called 'the Lubitsch touch' back in the day.",Positive,positive,positive,positive,"This review of ""Bluebeard's Eighth Wife"" is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting the film's comedic moments, clever plot, and strong performances from the cast. The reviewer praises the originality of the screenplay, which explores the concept of pre-nuptial agreements long before they became common practice. The chemistry between Gary Cooper and Claudette Colbert is noted, particularly in their humorous interactions, such as their initial meeting in a men's store. The supporting cast, including Herman Bing as a flustered detective, is also commended.

The reviewer does acknowledge some anachronisms, such as the casting of non-French actors in French roles, but this is not seen as a major issue. Instead, the reviewer focuses on the film's strengths, including its lighthearted tone and the ""Lubitsch touch,"" a term used to describe the director's signature style. Overall, the review presents ""Bluebeard's Eighth Wife"" as an enjoyable, charming film that showcases the talents of its cast and crew.

18730,"Ernst Lubitsch gave us wonderful films like Design for Living, Ninotchka, The Shop around the Corner, To be or not to be, and other wonderful films. But People usually put Bluebeard's eighth wife as one of Lubitsch's weakest films.<br /><br />But I consider this film as an important film. This film began the collaboration of Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder. Charles Brackett, Billy Wilder, and Walter Reisch wrote the screenplay for Ernst Lubitsch's Ninotchka. Of Course, Lubitsch worked with writers in the scripting process. After that, Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder worked together. They together wrote the screenplay for famous films like The Lost Weekend and Sunset Blvd.<br /><br />There are lots of funny moments in the film. I thought ""The Taming of the Shrew"" was very funny. There is a famous expression called ""Films are slices of Life."" And Here is a great example from Bluebeard's eighth wife (1938).<br /><br />At the first session of the scripting process, Lubitsch posed this question: how do the boy and girl get together? Billy Wilder promptly suggested that the opening scene should be the men's shop of a department store. ""The boy is trying to buy a pajama,"" he extemporized glibly. ""But he sleeps only in the tops. He is thrifty so he insists on buying only the tops. The clerk says he must buy the pants too. It looks like a catastrophe. Then the girl comes into the shop and buys the pants because she sleeps only in the pants."" Ernst Lubitsch and Charles Brackett were enchanted. It wasn't till months later they discovered that Billy Wilder himself is a tops-only sleeper and that he had been nursing the idea for months waiting for a chance to use it.<br /><br />I got this information from a book. I think this film can be considered as the return of Ernst Lubitsch. Right after this film, he made wonderful films like Ninotchka, The Shop around the Corner, and To be or not to be.<br /><br />I thought Gary Cooper's performance was good. I think Lubitsch casted Gary Cooper probably because Gary Cooper played Long Fellow Deeds who inherited the fortune in Frank Capra's Mr. Deeds goes to town. But this is just my opinion.<br /><br />As for me, I highly enjoyed the film. I rate this film 9 out of 10. Lubitsch films are different, because his films are slices of life.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review presents a contrarian view of Ernst Lubitsch's film ""Bluebeard's Eighth Wife"", which is often considered one of the director's weaker works. The reviewer, however, argues that the film is important due to its role in launching the collaboration between Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder, who would go on to write screenplays for famous films like ""The Lost Weekend"" and ""Sunset Blvd"". The reviewer highlights the film's humorous moments, citing the example of the opening scene where the protagonist tries to buy only the top of a pajama set, which was inspired by Billy Wilder's own sleeping habits.

The review is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer expressing admiration for the film's lighthearted and humorous tone, as well as Gary Cooper's performance. The reviewer also notes that the film marks a turning point in Lubitsch's career, preceding a string of successful films like ""Ninotchka"", ""The Shop around the Corner"", and ""To be or not to be"".

18731,"This film reappeared on channel 13 in the 1990s when they did a series of comedies from Hollywood in the 1930s and 1940s. In fact, to the tune of ""The Jolly Fat Policeman"", they had a montage of scenes from the films to introduce the series of people laughing, including one of Gary Cooper chortling when watching a film in a movie house - a sequence from this film.<br /><br />It all begins innocently enough when Cooper, a millionaire, goes into a fancy department store in France to buy pajamas. But he only likes to sleep in the tops. The clerk (Tyler Brooke) insists that he cannot sell half a pair of pajamas as Cooper wants. Claudette Colbert hears the argument and offers to help - she only likes to sleep in pajama bottoms. What if Brooke sells them each half? Brooke has never had such an offer before, so he goes to the floor walker (Rolfe Sedan) and asks him if this can be done. He is disturbed too - the request is quite unconventional. Eventually they contact the store's owner (Charles Halton). Halton is in bed, and gets out - his skinny frame supporting only a pajama top (if a suitably long one for the sake of censorship). Can they sell the two customers one set of pajamas (half for each)? Properly horrified, Halton answers, ""No, of course not! That is Communism!!"". So the sale is not allowed. Apparently nobody thinks that Cooper can buy the total pair and sell half to Colbert.<br /><br />Lubitsch's BLUEBEARD'S EIGHTH WIFE has had a reputation of falling flat, most viewers not liking it because of a misreading of Colbert's character. She is seen as quite mercenary towards Cooper - selling herself to him on her terms.<br /><br />Actually Cooper's character is the nastier, as he is rich and figures that everything has a price. He is correct most of the time. Look at the way Colbert's aristocratic pauper of a father, Edward Everett Horton, sees his new son-in-law as a golden goose he can use. Cooper's willingness to marry Colbert somehow includes an agreement that if he is hesitant or chooses to not marry her he has to pay damages. Horton, when he realizes this, takes out a watch, and (in a most reassuring voice) says to Cooper - ""Take your time my boy!"", to come to a decision. Later we see Horton's wardrobe has gotten more modern and fancier.<br /><br />The film, script by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett, compares well with their script for Mitchell Leisin's MIDNIGHT (also with Colbert, but with Don Ameche and John Barrymore). There Colbert is willing to sell herself for a money marriage to (to Francis Lederer), but it is complicated by a fictitious marriage to Ameche. She really loves Ameche (a taxi driver) but she explains to him in an unexpectedly realistic moment that her parents married ""for love"" but poverty made them grow to hate each other. This is not found in BLUEBEARD'S EIGHTH WIFE, where Colbert does not have a background like that (she is, after all, the daughter of a Marquis). Her mercenary plotting is to teach Cooper a lesson about his standards.<br /><br />The film has some nice work by the supporting staff, including Herman Bing as a private eye who turns out to be hiding things that Colbert learns about, and a young David Niven, who has a set of choice moments as a stand in punching bag and as a willing ear to Cooper. Coop tells Niven about his problems with Colbert, and how she is so infuriating. Niven listens respectfully. At the end, Cooper is touched by his willingness to hear what he had to say. ""Albert, how much do I pay you?"", Cooper asks him. Niven thinks and says, ""Thirty five francs a week sir."". Cooper looks deeply into his soul, and says (shaking his head), ""That's fair!""",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review provides a thoughtful analysis of the 1938 film ""Bluebeard's Eighth Wife,"" directed by Ernst Lubitsch and starring Gary Cooper and Claudette Colbert. The reviewer sets the context by mentioning how they first encountered the film on television in the 1990s and highlights the comedic tone of the movie. The plot is summarized, focusing on the initial encounter between Cooper's millionaire character and Colbert's aristocratic pauper, who engage in a battle of wits over a pair of pajamas. The reviewer argues that Colbert's character is often misinterpreted as mercenary, when in fact, she is trying to teach Cooper's character a lesson about his materialistic values.

The review praises the script by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett, comparing it favorably to their work on ""Midnight."" The supporting cast, including Herman Bing and David Niven, is also commended for their performances. The reviewer appreciates the film's witty dialogue and comedic moments, such as the exchange between Cooper and Niven at the end of the film.

18736,"I absolutely loved this movie. Great, realistic looking combat footage for one thing and a touching, genuine story also. The calm, understated manner of the lead character, Franta, makes him very likable. The human relationships in the story seemed so very typical and possible of what you could expect in war time. The bond between Franta and Carel shows the loyalty wartime comrades can have for each other and that is often described in books and interviews with veterans. The subtitles do not detract from the story at all and actually serve to underline the problems the Czech pilots had in the RAF. The postwar storyline is a great reminder that for many the suffering of WW2 did not end in 1945, especially in Russian occupied countries. The cinematography was also very good.

18737,"Centres on Czech WW2 pilots  the older Frantisek, the boyish impulsive Karel and in the background the quiet piano-playing Honza. As the film opens, it is 1950, the war is over and Frantisek and Honza are imprisoned in a former monastery. In their now Soviet-controlled native country they are 'enemy of the people'. Honza is severely maltreated by his Communist countrymen and dies.<br /><br />In 1939 many pilots manage to escape German-occupied Europe and make their way to England where they join the RAF. Notwithstanding their high motivation and experience they face RAF reluctance and British stiff upper lip. Finally they fight gallantly in the Battle of Britain. However, Frantisek and Karel find their friendship severely tested when they both fall for the same woman.<br /><br />In terms of romantic sub-plot, this is very similar to the Hollywood production Pearl Harbour. However, given the context of the film and Frantisek's eventual fate, it is also possible to read the English woman's treatment of the two men as symbolic of British treatment of the Czech and Polish RAF pilots: conveniently forgetting them once the war is over.<br /><br />In addition, the film is a lot less cliché than Pearl Harbour and the characters are more fully realised. Dark Blue World also scores in terms of its stunning aerial dogfights, which were seamlessly created using a mixture of models, actual live-action aerial filming and out-takes from the 1969 epic The Battle of Britain.<br /><br />In short, Dark Blue World is a well-made, moving, thought-provoking and exciting drama that puts the likes of Pearl Harbour to shame.

18738,"I'm Czech and soldiers (not only pilots) who escaped Czechoslovakia after Nazi's invasion in 1939 and fought against them abroad are true heroes and bravest men in our history for me. This movie from director of Academy Award winner ""Kolya"" (1996) is a tribute to these men. It's first big-screen movie about Czechoslovak WWII soldiers since ""Nebesti jezdci"" (1968). I think ""Dark Blue World"" is a good movie - good acting, good special effects, nice music etc. Movie is half in English and some actors are Britons. But greatest thing about this movie is it's pure existence. It's great chance to show people all around the world (and to many people in Czech Republic too...) that Czechoslovak role in WWII was not only as occupied country but as an active member of allied campaign.<br /><br />Leading characters are older and wiser Frantisek and young Karel. They escaped together from Czechoslovakia, they are flying in the same squadron and they fell in love with the same woman... Maybe it's a cliché but fortunately this storyline is not so aggressive and is in good balance with other scenes (including great dogfights). I don't want to compare ""Dark Blue World"" with ""Pearl Harbor"", someone will like PH more and someone will like DBW. But if you like happy ends, DBW is not for you. So, I think it's very good movie for everyone who likes this type of stories and very good movie who wants to get to know something about this chapter of Czechoslovak history.<br /><br />BTW, main theme ""Dark Blue World"" is from Czech 30's and 40's composer Jaroslav Jezek. He wrote this theme when he lost his eyes...",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer expressing admiration for the film ""Dark Blue World"" as a tribute to Czechoslovak heroes who fought against the Nazis during World War II. The reviewer, who is Czech, appreciates the film's portrayal of their country's active role in the Allied campaign, which is often overlooked. The reviewer praises the film's technical aspects, such as the acting, special effects, and music, as well as its ability to balance the storyline with action scenes, including impressive dogfights.

The reviewer also highlights the film's unique aspects, such as its bilingualism (with parts in English) and the inclusion of British actors. The reviewer notes that the film's storyline, which involves a love triangle between two pilots and a woman, is not overly aggressive and is well-balanced with other scenes. The reviewer also mentions that the film does not have a happy ending, which might not appeal to everyone.

The reviewer's personal connection to the film's subject matter and their appreciation for the film's historical significance are evident throughout the review. The reviewer concludes that ""Dark Blue World"" is a ""very good movie"" that is suitable for anyone interested in this type of story and those who want to learn more about Czechoslovak history.

18739,"This is a brilliant, lavish Czech film from the Sverak father and son team, all about two Czech pilots who flee to England to help the RAF in the Battle of Britain but who also fall out over a woman (the beautiful Tara Fitzgerald). Features some excellent and incredibly realistic aerial combat scenes  probably the best ever and much better than Pearl Harbour or even the film Battle of Britain - and a number of interesting general themes such as love, war, romance, comradeship, loss and servitude. Also, the trials and tribulations of moving abroad and learning a foreign language (though made easier here with the great stalwart Anna Massey).<br /><br />The film has some great little motifs such as the world famous RAF bullseye device, shown throughout and at one point nicely reflected in the black vinyl record, spinning around cutely (music is another theme of the film, of course). Plus, all of the traditional icons of English life: dimpled beer glasses (unlike the post-war straight glasses used in Pearl Harbour), tea in a nice china tea set in an English country garden (though shot in the Czech Republic?), the mascot dog, a vintage bottle of HP sauce, even a darts board!<br /><br />Of course, the airfield and surrounding countryside is ridiculously unlike anywhere in the south of England, though the virtuouso aerial sequences make up for this, showing Eastbourne and the Seven Sisters, always synonomous with southern England and the Battle of Britain. But best of all is the sensational musical score from Ondrej Soukup, as good as anything from Hans Zimmer yet all in the tradition of the late, excellent Ron Goodwin who scored the original Battle of Britain film amongst other classic English war films. There's even a nice little cameo role for the  apparently  famous Czech musician and actor (and Kevin Kline lookalike) Oldrich Kaiser, who plays on the piano the title theme song, Dark Blue Sky. Excellent!<br /><br />It's got a few smutty yet funny little Freudian devices too, such as always showing an inflated condom floating by the ceiling whenever Karel (the callow but brilliant Krystof Hadek) is stuck at the airfield while his love rival and fellow pilot Frantisek (Ondrej Vetchy) is with Susan.<br /><br />Another great English actor in this film! Charles Dance is of course fine as Wing Commander Bentley.<br /><br />Highly recommended and well worth watching/hiring  get the DVD with special features (stuff like how they created the dog fights and stuff). Probably the only film ever to combine subtitles with characters speaking English, German, French and Czech all at once.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the Czech film ""Dark Blue Sky"" for its lavish production, engaging storyline, and exceptional technical achievements. The reviewer highlights the film's realistic aerial combat scenes, which are considered superior to those in other notable films like ""Pearl Harbour"" and ""Battle of Britain"". The film's exploration of themes such as love, war, romance, and comradeship is also commended. The reviewer appreciates the attention to detail in the film's depiction of English culture, including the incorporation of iconic symbols like dimpled beer glasses, tea sets, and vintage HP sauce bottles.

The reviewer also praises the film's score, comparing it favorably to the work of Hans Zimmer and Ron Goodwin. The cameo appearance of Czech musician and actor Oldrich Kaiser is seen as a delightful addition to the film. The reviewer even appreciates the film's use of humor, including the Freudian device of an inflated condom floating by the ceiling to symbolize the protagonist's frustration. The performances of the cast, including Charles Dance, are also commended.

The review concludes by highly recommending the film and encouraging readers to watch or hire it, particularly with the special features DVD. The reviewer notes the unique aspect of the film, which combines subtitles with characters speaking multiple languages, including English, German, French, and Czech.

18740,"I was ""turned on"" to this movie by my flight instructor and now I wonder how the heck it was out there for nearly five years before I finally discovered it. If you have any love of flying at all, especially an attachment to the planes of WWII, this is an absolute must see, vastly superior to the pathetic ""Pearl Harbor"" and up there in rivalry with the famed ""Battle of Britain"" filmed more than thirty years ago. There are moments when you feel as if you are flying wingman, literally dodging the shell casings of your leader as you roll in on a Me 109 or He 111. <br /><br />As an historian this film deeply touched me as well for it is about the plight endured by tens of thousands of gallant Poles, Hungarians, Slovaks and Czechs who in 1939-1940 fled their homelands, made it to England, fought with utmost bravery for the survival of western civilization, and then were so callously abandoned by ""us"" after the war when they were arrested by the communists upon their return to their native lands. I have stood atop Monte Cassino in Italy and was moved to tears by the cemetery for the Polish troops that stormed that mountain that British and Americans could not take. I have traveled as well to Prague (the most beautiful of cities) and studied their history. Their story of abandonment, I believe, should be a lesson to us even today about obligations to gallant allies. <br /><br />But back to the film. If you love flying, see this. If you are interested in the aircraft of WWII most definitely see it. Without doubt the most brutal, direct, and frightfully swift air combat scenes ever replicated for film. And yes, if you even are seeking a touching romance, there is that as well in heartbreaking detail.<br /><br />Bill Forstchen Professor of History Co-owner of a WWII replica ""warbird"" P-51 Mustang ""Gloria Ann""",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is extremely positive, with the reviewer expressing their enthusiasm and admiration for the film.

The theme of betrayal runs deep through the movie, from betrayal of love, to betrayal of friendship, and finally the betrayal shown by the communist regime to former RAF pilots post-war.<br /><br />A desperately sad film, all the more so because it is so factually accurate.

18743,"I've been a devoted IMDB visitor for a few years. This is the movie that finally compelled me to write in a review.<br /><br />I caught this movie by chance (the opening credits happened to be scrolling past when I turned my TV on one morning). I thoroughly enjoyed the film for many reasons, all of which have been well covered by other reviewers -- the moodiness, the forgotten history of the Czech pilots, the subtle charm of the supporting characters, the fatalism of the main characters, and the first person view during the battle scenes.<br /><br />But the element of ""Dark Blue World"" that really stood out was the lack of dramatic effects, especially during combat (and this is a good thing!). While the pilots were flying in battle no musical score accompanied them, no manipulative shots of worried spouses/girlfriends were interwoven, every little aerial maneuver did not elicit trite patriotic cheers, and viewers weren't asked to swallow unbelievable James Bond-esque pilot heroics. Instead the audience is allowed to feel the melancholy, fear and isolation of these single pilot fighters while they try to stay aloft during combat. As comrades are shot down we are spared tearful howls and the typical (but audience pleasing) revenge based heroics. Instead the other pilots sadly and quietly observe their fellow pilot's fate -- in reality they still need to remain intensely focused on their own safety and objectives at that very moment. We only briefly experience the pilot's breathing and the background roar of the engines as we, the audience, witness a friend spiral quietly down to his death. And then immediately 'we' need to jump back into combat mode and focus on survival.<br /><br />Too often in Hollywood we're spoon-fed the emotions we're supposed to feel and no room is left for the viewer's imagination. ""Dark Blue World"" maintains a sparseness that captivates and involves the viewer, allowing us to invest in the movie and fill in the gaps and spaces using our own thoughts and feelings.<br /><br />Excellent film, well worth seeing.",Positive,positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer expressing their admiration for the film ""Dark Blue World"" and its unique approach to storytelling. The reviewer highlights the film's ability to create a moody atmosphere, its attention to forgotten history, and the charm of its supporting characters. However, what truly sets the film apart is its understated and realistic portrayal of combat scenes, devoid of manipulative music, melodrama, and over-the-top heroics. The reviewer praises the film's subtlety, allowing the audience to fill in the emotional gaps and invest in the story.

The reviewer's enthusiasm is evident in their writing, as they appreciate the film's ability to evoke feelings of melancholy, fear, and isolation without resorting to clichés. The reviewer also commends the film's realistic depiction of pilots' reactions to comrades' deaths, focusing on the need for survival rather than indulging in sentimental outbursts. This approach, the reviewer argues, allows the audience to engage more deeply with the film and fill in the emotional gaps, making the experience more immersive and captivating.

The review concludes with a strong endorsement, encouraging readers to see the film. The reviewer's tone is enthusiastic and appreciative, indicating a deep admiration for the film's unique approach and its ability to evoke a strong emotional response.

18744,"This is a beautifully-made film, finely balancing the fragile human stories (both before and after 1945) and the indiscriminating combat of war. The use of outtakes from Battle of Britain (a film that does not nearly so well portray the 1940s!) enhances, rather than detracts from the whole. A deeply impressive work, this lived in my memory for the 2 years since I saw it, and I have just bought it to explore the making-of extras.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film (movie). Like ""Aces High"", it alternates between viscerally exciting (or scary) air combat sequences, where the viewer might experience actual loss of characters they'd come to care about, but also unpredictable interactions on the ground, where skillful writers and real-life experiences inform some involving and moving events. This also underlines the fact that for many people, 1945 marked not just the end of one conflict but the beginning of another, and even today we still don't recognise the loss, bravery and sacrifice of so many nameless heroes, or even worse we venerate them from a distance without allowing them to be human beings with all the emotional weaknesses that entails - making their sacrifices all the more valiant.<br /><br />Watching this movie is an experience which will take you from the heights of friendship to the depths of jealousy, and back to love that endures even beyond death. If all war films were like this, we'd never have to fight again.<br /><br />Did I mention it's worth watching? ;-)<br /><br />10/10",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is extremely positive, praising the film for its masterful balance of human stories and war combat, as well as its effective use of archival footage from ""Battle of Britain"".

18745,"Since growing up in Czechoslovakia I was following history of RAF pilots and crews in WWII Great Britain, their stories and tragic ending either in the combat or in communist prisons and camps.

18747,"I came out of ""Dark Blue World"" feeling (sigh) 'so sad' yet it was definitely a film needed to be made, and it's truly well done from Czech Republic. It's entertaining in spite of the 'sad' premise. It is full of feelings, the bonding and undeniably true friendship between the two lead characters - one mature lieutenant pilot (Ondrej Vetchý as Franta) and the young & ever-so-eager budding pilot (Krystof Hádek as Karel), the inevitable love triangle, and the now and then reminders of the grim prison situations in Czechoslovakia in the '50s. It's all in one film put together, by the father screenwriter and son director team Zdenek and Jan Sverák (previous achievement being the lovable ""Kolya"").<br /><br />It's not as long as ""East-West"" (French ""Est-Ouest"") 1999, which was heart wrenching, multi-layered story about a returning Russian doctor and French wife's ill-fates after WWII in Russia. The plot of ""Tmavomodrý svet"" (title in Czech) is quite straightforward and has sprinkles of light humor. Music, songs of WWII England sung in Czech, modest special effects of pilots and air crafts in the sky - not elaborate like Hollywood - there's no need to be bing, bang, boom all the time when showing air battle scenes. The sadness was explained up front in the beginning (two paragraphs in English) and wrap up with follow up paragraphs. The film is not totally subtitled, only when translating the Czech conversations - the rest are in English, be it very British or in Czech accents. (So it's a foreign film with English language and includes British actors.) <br /><br />The three lead performances, especially of the two Czech pilots, were wonderfully delivered. There are nuances between the two of them, even though it's the steadily mature vs. the eagerly young. I always appreciate Tara Fitzgerald: yes, there's ""Brassed Off"" 1996 opposite Ewan McGregor and Pete Postlethwaite; remembered her from ""Hear My Song"" 1991 opposite Adrian Dunbar and Ned Beatty; opposite Hugh Grant in ""Sirens"" 1994 and ""The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill and Came Down a Mountain"" 1995, besides her appearances in PBS Masterpiece Theatre mini-series. <br /><br />'So sad' - the fact that heroes defending one's country can be so ill fatedly treated and for so long (40 years). Thank goodness for worthwhile memories and the imprints of friendship unforgettable. Hence the pause for a ray of sunshine through a stain glass window (ironic or coincidental that it's of a church where the hard labor took place) - symbolic of hope, never give up <br /><br />Other recent films that have stories needed to be told: ""Kandahar"" (with Nelofer Pazira as Nafas the Canadian from Afghanistan taking a journey to Kandahar with a personal 'mission' in mind) more than meets the eye behind a burqa by Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf. ""Everything Put Together"" (with Radha Mitchell as a new mother facing SID - sudden infant death) insightful film by Swiss director Marc Forster, and his much talked about controversial film ""Monster's Ball"" (I've yet to catch) with Halle Berry, Billy Bob Thornton and Peter Boyle. See the films without prior expectations or comparisons to films before.

18748,"If you want to see the true, vile nature of Communism, watch the movie DARK BLUE WORLD. (Tvamomodrý Svet) It recounts how the brave Czech pilots who refused to surrender fled to England to join the fight against the Nazis. After the war, the Communists feared they had picked up dangerous Western ideas about freedom. So, they had these heroic Czech pilots thrown into a nightmarish prison, where some of the guards were the same Nazis they risked their lives to defeat.<br /><br />If Hollywood wants to understand why so many of their movies fall flat, they should compare the character drama portions of ""Pearl Harbor"" with this movie. In Dark Blue World, you really make a connection to all the characters. In Pearl Harbor, everyone is like some slick cartoon version of a real person.<br /><br />There are innumerable instances of brilliant writing in this movie. One funny scene that sticks in my mind is when the character Karel is being taught English by a rather formal Englishwoman. When he can't pronounce a word, he ridicules the lesson. In typical stoic English fashion, the teacher calmly but forcefully confronts Karel, and shames him into behaving.<br /><br />The aerial battle sequences in this movie are amazing, and they help to keep the movie lively. I read that it cost $11,000 an hour to rent the planes, but it was worth every penny.<br /><br />Ladies, you are expected to cry at sad movies, but guys.... beware!

The review also commends the film's brilliant writing, citing a specific scene where a character is taught English by a formal Englishwoman, which showcases the film's humor and wit.

The reviewer also praises the film's aerial battle sequences, which are described as ""amazing"" and worth the high cost of renting the planes. The review concludes with a warning to male viewers, stating that the film is emotionally powerful enough to make even the toughest individuals weep, and that dog lovers should be prepared to use a lot of tissues.

18749,"It seems that no matter how many films are made on the subject, there is no shortage of stories that emerge from the Second World War. It stands to reason that a conflict on such a scale as global warfare would capture the imagination of filmmakers everywhere and provide them with ample material on which to base a story. Heading in a different direction than most mainstream movies about the war is Dark Blue World, a film that does not deal with the traditional major battles of the war, does not tell the story of many of its major figures, and does not even focus on soldiers of any of the major allied or axis powers. Dark Blue World instead ventures into the world of refugee soldiers fighting in exile for their occupied nations.<br /><br />The film does a marvelous job of portraying the challenges faced by Czech pilots flying under the British Royal Air Force, expressing the frustration that they felt both at the language barrier between them and the other fliers, but also at being restrained from achieving vengeance against the Germans until being re-trained.<br /><br />Dark Blue World also works quite well outside the arena of the war film as being a story about human relationships. A love triangle develops between the two main characters and an English woman that complicates the teacher-mentor relationship of the two exiled soldiers. This relationship is extremely well acted throughout, developing into almost a father and son relationship at many points.<br /><br />The aerial combat in the film is among some of the best and is also very interesting in exploring the cultural challenges mentioned above as the men struggle to fly their machines, fight the enemy, and relay commands and replies in an unfamiliar language. The tension and struggle of these scenes continues the tension between the men on the ground, just as the tension on the ground continues that felt in the air.<br /><br />This may not be a film for everyone. The hardcore war film buff may find its exploration of relationships a bit off-putting, but it is on the whole an excellent film regardless of the bellicose element or not.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review of ""Dark Blue World"" is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting the film's unique approach to telling a World War II story by focusing on Czech pilots fighting in exile with the British Royal Air Force. The reviewer praises the film's portrayal of the challenges faced by these refugee soldiers, including the language barrier and the frustration of being restrained from seeking vengeance against the Germans. The review also commends the film's exploration of human relationships, particularly the love triangle between the two main characters and an English woman, which is well-acted and develops into a complex, almost paternal relationship.

The reviewer also highlights the film's aerial combat scenes, which are considered some of the best, and the way they effectively convey the cultural challenges faced by the characters. The tension and struggle in these scenes are seen as a continuation of the tension on the ground, adding to the overall sense of drama and conflict. While the reviewer acknowledges that the film may not appeal to hardcore war film enthusiasts who might find the focus on relationships off-putting, they conclude that ""Dark Blue World"" is an excellent film regardless of its bellicose element.

18750,"Compared to Battle of Britain, this is a real film, with real characters and a real plot. Battle of Britain is basically a documentary with the occasional Lawrence Olivier and Michael Caine, but the real protagonists are the Spits, the Hurricanes, etc. Here, on the other hand, you have two well-wrought characters (actually three) and a real plot. I strongly recommend it to anybody, even to those who are not particularly fond of war movies. It's well filmed, and I wonder what the director might do if he had the big capitals behind him.

18751,"Absolutely one of the best aviation movies of all times on so many levels. Hardware junkies will drool over the largest single massing of flyable Spitfires outside of a Battle of Britain reenactment. No less than eight flying Spits are on hand for very accurate ground and air sequences.<br /><br />Those that marvel over the lore of flying and get misty-eyed reciting High Flight will identify with the central characters' reverence for the freedom of being fast, free and high in their Dark Blue World. Be warned: romantics and even dog lovers are treated to a very emotional ride in this movie. The core message is one that is shared by many war vets, in that their finest hours, their period of life when they felt most alive, was in fact during the war when everything else is sad and gray.<br /><br />The plot concerns Czech pilots who escape from their country when the Nazis invade and join the RAF Free Czech Squadron. There are a few subplots, all of which are worth careful attention. This is just a plain old excellent movie that even the most ardent anti-hardware romantic will love (keep the Kleenex on hand).

18752,"A nicely paced romantic war story that should have got more exposure. The Czech pilot who played piano gives a mellow touch to the story. The flying footage may not have been enough for aviation buffs like myself, but then again, this really isn't an action movie. Though it does not have anything in common with the James Salter novel ""The Hunters"" that became the movie about Korean War F86 Sabre pilots, Dark Blue World had a similar feel but with more of a romantic element to it.

I can only imagine how he would feel when his friend make the ultimate sacrifice.<br /><br />I see a slight similarity to 'Pearl Harbor', which is also about two pilots falling in love with the same woman.

18756,"Engaging entry from Europe about Czech fighter pilots flying for the RAF during WW2. It's always interesting as an American to see a new point of view on familiar events in history. There's nothing terribly original or revolutionary about the style in which this is filmed or the romantic love triangle that anchors the narrative. Still, it is compelling all the way through. There is a good balance between drama, romance, humor, action, and symbolism that is understated beautifully by the director and cast.

18757,"Along with having minor flaws to it, this film is a masterpiece, and most definitely the best war film I've seen. Not the mention it's one of the best films I've seen in all genres. I might have written this for No Man's Land before, but now I think this one's better. It's VERY sad in the ending, and I almost cried after the two shocking scenes that came within 5 minutes close to the film's final. <br /><br />Karel's performance as the main character was fascinating although he's supposed to be a rookie considering his age. This film makes you think a lot, makes you cry (or at least gets you close to it), and makes you hate any kind of war and political BS. The flashbacks to the prison-hospital make the film even more delicious. <br /><br />One tiny flaw about the film is the non-British accents of supposedly British people. Most of the British people on screen were actually British, but how about the ones who are supposed to be British and speak with a foreign accent? That really didn't fit into this adorable film. But it's pretty much the only flaw I've noticed. Effects could also be a bit better but then again, we all remember many films from one particular land that have tremendous FX and absolutely nothing else. <br /><br />Briefly, this film is a total masterpiece and every single individual should see it. If you want to travel to the Czechoslovakia of 40's, and if you want to virtually witness a tremendous amount of emotions at once, this film is for you. If you don't want to do those, this film will make you want to do so.",Positive,positive,positive,positive,"This review is extremely positive, with the reviewer calling the film a ""masterpiece"" and stating that it's not only the best war film they've seen but also one of the best films they've seen in any genre.

18760,"I saw this film in Wales in July. It deals with the courage of Czech pilots who flew numerous missions for the RAF after their country had been occupied by the Nazis. In this film, the action takes place both in the early 1950's when these pilots are being beaten in political prisons in Czeckoslavakia and during World War II in Britain. They were imprisoned after their return to their homeland because the Communist regime viewed these warriors as a threat to their occupation of Czeckoslavakia. The pilots maintain their dignity in prison and during numerous air battles against Nazi pilots. This film contain a love sub-plot that does make sense because it helps us to understand that both civilians and soldiers made great sacrifices to preserve democracy. The end of this film indicates that the heroism of these Czech pilots was finally recognized in the early 1990's after the restoration of democracy in the country then known as Czeckoslavakia. This powerful and moving film was made with financial support from the Czech government.

18762,"""For a Squadron Leader - normally the only guy trained and equipped for navigation in a squadron and very hard to replace - to risk an expensive plane and himself to pick up a crashed fellow pilot, no matter how close a friend he is, in the face of oncoming enemy troops, is hard to believe, especially when they both have to share a cramped Spitfire cockpit - two into a Skyraider, OK, but a Spit?! Come on, this part of the film is a Biggles adventure, not fitting a film that one is supposed to take seriously!"" as said by Tord S Eriksson (Gothenburg, Sweden) is rubbish. Not at all Biggles. One true story of the war comes to mind of two grounded spit pilots, who planned and flew (illegally) a strafing mission over France. One had to crash land and his friend landed his spit under fire, while German infantry was moving in on them, and flew them both out of there. In a spit. They were BOTH severely injured in former fights, one had an artificial leg from the knee down. Now that may sound like something out of Bigles, but it happened.

18765,"Instead of watching the recycled history of ""Pearl Harbor"" with nothing new to reveal except for a couple of real events involving a few individuals thrown in so the makers of the film could say they contributed to the spread of history, along with nothing but CGI explosions filling in for a sappy romantic triangle. One should go see Dark Blue World.<br /><br />This film takes place during the historic time in WWII which the Czech pilots left their homeland and went to fight for the RAF instead of laying down their arms and giving in to the Nazis. It was a part of history that should at least be told once to the outside world. A love triangle takes place between the main characters, but one of them does not die off conveniently like in Pearl Harbor, but through sacrifice for true friendship. The movie is tragedy after tragedy, with not even a bittersweet ending, with our hero not enjoying glory of taking his country back, the return of love by his current lover, the return of love by his reunited lover, or even the return of unconditional love by his life long pet. He is utterly heartbroken and feels no worse off in the Russian labor camp.

18770,"I, as many IMDB patrons seem to have, stumbled upon this little film when it appeared on the Canadian ""Showcase Network"". I was, as many of you, also sucked in and watched the entire film. I was hooked, at first, by the literate dialogue and wry sense of humour that the film is rich with. I was coasting along comfortably on a sort of ""Kevin Smith meets Killer Films"" wave until half way through when the movie really buckled down and explored it's themes in more detail... with a decidedly darker and more poignant edge. Far from being taken out of the experience, I was brought further in. This is not the best film of it's kind and will certainly not have universal appeal... so I do understand some of the more negative reactions to it. But I bought in... and enjoyed it immensely. The ""flash back"" type movement in the chronology was effective, the characters were well-realized and the issues raised were human, accessible (to my experience anyway) and interesting. I was quite impressed with the film's ability to remain sweet, funny and entertaining while not shying away from controversial subject matter and raw emotional language, dynamics and situations. This movie is a great antidote to a lot of the schlock that has permeated the witty/clever romantic genre. A kind of male Brigitte Jones for the literate sect. Take 2 hours out of your busy schedule and jump into Wirey's world... or you could go rent ""You've Got Mail"", 'cause if that appeals to you, you won't like this anyway!

18772,"The biggest problem that the TV program Key West faced was that it was advertised wrong. If you saw the ads you would think it was a jiggle how, and be sorely disappointed. It was a vastly more complex show than that. <br /><br />I happened to be in Key West just before Hurricane Andrew hit, and I think I actually found myself having a drink or two with some of the cast in Rum Runners. Of course, that was before the show hit. I did see the sailboat that was in the opening go by a few times, and chatted with the guy who you see hacking up coconuts in the opening too. HE was a real local.

18773,"""MY WIFE AND KIDS,"" in my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I haven't seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. There are many episodes that I enjoyed. One of them was where Junior (George O. Gore II) got his driver's license. If you want to know why, you'll have to have seen it for yourself. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong.

18774,"This show was crap when it first came on. The first actress that played the daughter didn't fit the role, the writing was hit or miss, and Damon Wayans CLEARLY wasn't comfortable doing such a cornball family friendly show. The chemistry between himself and Tisha Cambell (they're long time friends, as are all of the Wayans clan with Tisha's husband and Will Smith and Jada Pinkett) DID work so they retooled the show. Once it returned, they recast the daughter, made the son much dumber (a la Eric from ""Boy Meets World"")and made the youngest daughter into a genius...(later they gave her a little genius boyfriend to do comedic guest appearances). The show, while if often rollercoasters from over the top buffoonery to being corny walks the line enough to keep it as a show that you can see Damon Wayans be comfortable in his own skin on the set (especially since the main writers, directors and consultants were ALL members of the Wayans family) AND in his character. Once everyone had been on the show for a while, they worked to everyone in the casts strengths and were able to make a consistently funny show on the air.<br /><br />However, there is TOO MUCH buffoonery, too many over the top antics, and oftentimes too much chaos happening in the life of the Kyle family. They made Junior TOO STUPID, they also made the eldest daughter an attractive, clumsy idiot from time to time and the youngest daughter wasn't even spared by the writers. I feel they jumped the shark and signed the shows death warrant when Junior got his girlfriend pregnant, she moved in and he married her and her parents were introduced (Junior's wife's father's character makes me WINCE just thinking about him). The show remained funny...but it was a UPN show on ABC if that makes any sense to the reader.<br /><br />The reruns are funny enough, but I'm relieved it's over...there was nowhere left to go with it. When it's bad it's REALLY BAD. It tends to be cornball at times but at least he was a black man who had a sitcom make it to syndication on a major network..Who can say that for themselves now? (Given the CW merger and the ""brownout"" on TV networks lately, that is). One.",Positive,"Mixed, but overall: Negative",Mixed,mixed,"This review is a mixed assessment of the TV show, highlighting both its strengths and weaknesses. Initially, the reviewer criticizes the show's early stages, citing poor casting, inconsistent writing, and Damon Wayans' apparent discomfort with the family-friendly tone. However, they acknowledge that the show improved after retooling, with the recasting of the daughter, the development of the son's character, and the introduction of the youngest daughter's genius persona. The reviewer praises the show's ability to find its footing, leveraging the strengths of the cast, particularly Damon Wayans, who seemed more comfortable in his role.

However, the reviewer also expresses frustration with the show's excessive buffoonery, over-the-top antics, and chaotic storylines, which they believe detracted from the show's overall quality. They specifically criticize the character development of Junior, the eldest daughter, and the youngest daughter, feeling that they were often portrayed in a negative or stereotypical light. The reviewer also believes that the show ""jumped the shark"" with the introduction of Junior's girlfriend and her family, which marked a decline in the show's quality.

Despite these criticisms, the reviewer acknowledges that the show remained funny and was a significant achievement for a black-led sitcom on a major network. They express relief that the show has ended, as they felt it had run its course.

18778,"If you take the Huxtable parents and blend them with the Kyle parents you get a perfect blend of over the top and under the edge parenting that you can wish for your own family child-rearing skills.

18791,"For all intents and purposes, 'Teen Devian' might seem like just another lightweight Bollywood musical. To some extent, this might even be true, especially because the producers had to be sure that the film succeeded with the masses. But somewhere behind the scenes, either Sadashiv Brahmam (who had the 'idea' for this story) or Amerjeet (who directed the film) decided that there would be a twist to the usual formula, and succeeded perhaps beyond even their own expectations.<br /><br />This is not simply about a handsome man flirting with 3 women, undecided on whom to choose as his life's partner. Dev Anand's character was really in love with each of the 3 women at various times, and they with him, despite being aware of the other two. Dev Anand's relationship with Simi and Kalpana is particularly interesting - in that each of the women comes to depend on him heavily. There are quite a lot of suggestive teasers in the stars' body language that lend themselves to imagination depending on the viewer's maturity. The theme is surprisingly adult and after all that it was ashame that the ending was tame, obviously designed to please the masses and deflect criticism.",Positive,Positive,Positive,positive,"This review presents a nuanced evaluation of the Bollywood film ""Teen Devian"". On the surface, the film appears to be a typical lighthearted musical, but the reviewer suggests that there is more depth to the story than initially meets the eye. The filmmakers, Sadashiv Brahmam and Amerjeet, are credited with adding a twist to the usual formula, which elevates the film beyond expectations. The reviewer highlights the complexity of the relationships between the protagonist, played by Dev Anand, and the three women in his life, noting that each woman has a deep emotional connection with him. The reviewer praises the suggestive body language and mature themes explored in the film, which add a layer of sophistication to the narrative.

However, the reviewer expresses disappointment with the film's ending, which they deem ""tame"" and overly concerned with pleasing the masses. This criticism notwithstanding, the review is largely positive, acknowledging the film's ability to transcend its genre and explore more mature themes.

18792,"I think it was way back in 1987 that we had our exams and my friend and I saw in the papers that one of the theatres was playing 'teen deviyan'. We decided to go just for the heck of it without hoping anything great. But we were in for a pleasant surprise. The movie was made in 1965 but even by today's standards, the plot was absolutely modern and way ahead of its times. The music was wonderful and Dev Anand as a city bred looked and acted his best. I still remember that elated feeling when we came out of the theatre after the movie was over. <br /><br />Whoever thought of this story of one man falling for three very different girls at the same time? No he is not three timing or fooling them but he genuinely likes all three of them for different reasons. One is homely, one is an actress and the third is a 'high society' girl who can also help Dev in his career as a poet. The question is which one is the 'One' for him. What makes the matter worse is that all three of them like him too. When things come to an impasse, a hypnotist takes him in and in his hypnotized state he dreams of his future with each one of them and reaches the right decision.<br /><br />This dream of his which is the only colored part in an otherwise black-n-white movie is the crux of the film but surprisingly is edited out from most of the versions available today. If you want to watch this movie make sure that this part is intact. In case you watch this movie without this part and get confused, don't worry because you just watched an incomplete movie.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer sharing a personal anecdote about discovering the 1965 film ""Teen Deviyan"" in 1987 and being pleasantly surprised by its modern and ahead-of-its-time plot. The reviewer praises the film's music, Dev Anand's performance, and the unique storyline, which revolves around a man who genuinely falls for three different women and must navigate his feelings to make a decision.

The reviewer highlights the film's clever use of a hypnotist-induced dream sequence, which serves as a pivotal moment in the film, allowing the protagonist to envision his future with each of the three women. The reviewer emphasizes the importance of watching a complete version of the film, including this dream sequence, to fully appreciate the story.

The tone of the review is nostalgic and enthusiastic, with the reviewer still recalling the ""elated feeling"" they experienced after watching the film. The use of phrases like ""pleasant surprise"" and ""way ahead of its times"" further reinforces the reviewer's admiration for the film.

18793,"I saw Teen Devian in 1993 telecasted in Doordarshan on a Friday night, and could scarcely believe that such a remarkable film was ever made in Bollywood. It was mind blowing  a film with a ""modern"" storyline, superb music, three lovely ladies and my fave superstar Dev Anand.In this unusual storyline, Dev falls in love with three women  the simple Nanda, the ravishing Kalpana and the sophisticated Simi. They too are enamored with him and want to marry him. This puts Dev in a dilemma (which is the crux of the storyline)- whom to marry?. He consults a hypnotist who asks Dev to gaze into a crystal ball. Dev finds the answer and marries Nanda. Beautifully directed (most probably by Dev saheb himself & not by Amarjeet the official director) the B&W classic has evergreen music  some of SD Burman's (helped generously by RD Burman) best compositions. ""Uff kitni thadni hai yeh ruth"" is the probably the most sexiest song ever composed in Hindi films. Credit should also be given to Majrooh Sultanpuri for penning the memorable lyrics Teen Devian is a breezy musical which completely suited the style of Dev Anand and he did full justice to the role.

18795,"Teen Deviyaan is a great film. A very breezy entertainer and a very modern film for its time in the 1960s. The Music and songs are terrific though the lyrics of Majrooh are meaningless at places. Dev Anand is a tremendous star and as usual does great justice to his role. Kalpana is sexy and Nanda is OK.

18801,"Michael Ritchie's ""The Couch Trip"" is a wonderfully anarchic comedy about what makes a good psychiatrist. It is so subtle and wicked that you start to realize what a stinging satire it really is. It is also Dan Akyroyd's best movie, made in a particularly great film year (1988)for him. First, ""The Great Outdoors"" and now this.<br /><br />Akyroyd stars as John Burns, a career crook who fakes insanity to escape prison. Now, a dumb comedy would just be about this. But ""The Couch Trip"" uses this as a springboard for everything else. Beverly Hills psychiatrist George Maitlin (Charles Grodin, subtly hilarious here)has a nervous breakdown and a replacement is selected: Lawrence Baird, who happens to be Akyroyd's psychiatrist! You can pretty much guess what's going to happen, but the great thing about ""The Couch Trip"" is not what happens, but how it is done. <br /><br />""The Couch Trip"" gives Dan Akyroyd the best role he has ever had. His John Burns is one of the truly original comic creations in movie history. Wicked one liners and physical humor are a part of it, but what makes it special is that Akyroyd makes Burns a lovable character. We root for him and grow to like him a whole lot during the 98 minute running time.<br /><br />But Akyroyd isn't alone here. He gets strong support from other great comic actors. Walter Matthau joins the hilarity as a con artist minister who catches on to Burns' secret and commits genteel blackmail. Charles Grodin ""slow burns"" his way to another great comic role as the burned out psychiatrist. Grodin has been one of the most underappreciated actors in Hollywood. It's criminal they haven't used him more often. Richard Romanus plays Grodin's slimeball lawyer to perfection.<br /><br />""The Couch Trip"" is one of many films made by the now-defunct Orion Pictures Corporation that are currently unseen. MGM spent a fortune buying the Orion library but have yet to truly cash in on their acquisition. ""The Couch Trip"" joins ""Dressed to Kill"", ""Blow Out"" and countless others in gathering dust rotting in the vault. Shame on MGM for their inaction. Hopefully, with new management, ""The Couch Trip"" will find the audience and respect it deserves.<br /><br />**** out of 4 stars",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is extremely positive, praising ""The Couch Trip"" as a wonderfully anarchic comedy that is both subtle and wicked.

The only person that knows he's an imposter is the drunken priest (Walter Matthau) who comes along to be pampered by Ackroyd's new found wealth having blakmailed him.

18804,"I first saw The Couch Trip (1988)on late night television years ago and instantly fell in love with it. The funny thing is I usually catch all the comedies made but have never even heard of this one until I saw it. Dan Ackroyd is plain and simpley hillarious period. He has made a couple great movies with Belushi and don't forget Saturday Night Live. But I think the Couch Trip is probably his best and funniest. With a good supporting cast of Charles Grodin, David Clennon, and Walter Matthau this piece of cinema shines with comic gold. Ackroyd's wife Donna Dixxon even does a fine job here. My favorite moments of the film involve Ackroyd and David Clennon's charachter Lawrence Baird. Those two played well off each other. So if you haven't seen a good comedy in awile take a trip back to 1988 and rent or buy The Couch Trip. I just did, Amazon 78 cents. What a bargain, too bad I got hit with a 2.50 shipping fee.

18806,"A lot of people don't think Dan Aykroyd is funny. This movie proves otherwise. Aykroyd is brilliant delivering his one-liners in this comedy. The only major problem with this is that it wastes far too much time near the end jumping back and forth from Aykroyd's character and the doctor who is pursuing him to prove he's a fraud.

18809,"To say I wasn't expecting much sitting down to watch ""The Couch Trip"" is an understatement. I had no idea what it was about - I thought it was going to be a journey into the realm of sexuality when I heard Chevy Chase played a condom man and the movie's title involves the word ""couch trip,"" *wink, wink.* Then I figured out that it had something to do with a mental institute and a patient escaping. My expectations dropped even lower.<br /><br />I was literally expecting a grin movie - the type where you grin once and walk out feeling a bit cheated. And in a way, this is cheap comedy - it doesn't have the greatest gags, the plot is ludicrous, but you know what? I had a big dumb smile on my face the entire time I was watching it.<br /><br />Dan Aykroyd plays John Burns, a patient at a mental hospital who may or may not actually be mental. He gives the psychiatrist, Lawrence Baird (David Clennon), plenty of grief and misery, which leads us to believe he is a sane person after all.<br /><br />Following a little bit of a riot in the mental institute's cafeteria, Burns is awaiting a tongue-lashing from Baird in his office when the phone rings. Burns picks it up, pretends to be Baird, and finds out the caller on the other line, Harvey Michaels (Richard Romanus), wants the real Dr. Baird to come fill in for a radio shrink named George Maitlin (Charles Grodin), who is taking a vacation with his wife, Vera (Mary Gross). Michaels wants Baird so bad he has even booked him a ticket on an airplane.<br /><br />Burns escapes the institute with the help of a receptionist, and drives to O'Hare. He gets Dr. Baird's ticket, gets on the plane, and eventually poses on the air as Dr. Baird. His show is a phenomenal success. ""People love him!"" one man says, and the other man replies, ""It's because he actually cares about them.""<br /><br />Donald Becker (the late, great Walter Matthau) is an ex-mental patient who recognizes Burns' clothes to be confinement-issued pants and shirts. To keep him quiet, Burns promises Becker a percentage of his income. The secret is kept closed.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Maitlin and his wife get in an argument. He flies home to end his vacation short and realizes that the man on his talk show is not, in fact, Dr. Baird after all, but no one believes him. He gets the real Dr. Baird, but unfortunately he has lost his ID so the police take them as nutcases and don't listen to their story.<br /><br />Let me name just a few of the plot holes I noticed while watching this film: Burns poses as Dr. Baird, but is never asked for his ID, even when claiming his plane ticket (he was robbed, he says, but they would still make sure he is Baird). If Burns becomes so very famous, how come the real Dr. Baird in Chicago never heard people talking about him? Word travels. And finally, why would the police ever arrest Maitlin and Baird (the real Baird, that is) without following up on their stories?<br /><br />To be frankly honest, I couldn't care less. I went into this movie with a closed mind and it surprised me - I really liked it. It entertained me. Its ideas are essentially ludicrous and not at all realistic, but Dan Aykroyd gives a truly spirited performance as a half-a-loon that makes ""The Couch Trip"" a trip worth taking. <br /><br />3.5/5 stars -<br /><br />John Ulmer",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is a pleasant surprise, as the reviewer initially had low expectations for the film ""The Couch Trip"" but ended up enjoying it despite its flaws.

18810,"Dan Ackroyd in his prime stars as Johgn Burns, a mental asylum escapee who poses as his own shrink to travel out to La La Land and host a popular radio talk show while the regular host (Charle Grodin in his snarling prime) takes a vacation.

18811,"""The Couch Trip"" is one of those silly comedies that they cranked out in the '80s. In this case, Dan Aykroyd plays a mental patient who poses as a psychiatrist, and he goes to Beverly Hills to sub for Charles Grodin. Most of the movie's humor springs from their satirical look at Beverly Hills and people's empty lives there (a woman has a power struggle with her maid).<br /><br />It's the sort of movie that you just watch to have a good time.

18821,"This story of a teacher who has a relationship with a student is told in a subtle manner, something which sets it apart from most films with this plot. Mr. Lam (Jacky Cheung) has a relationship with Choy (Karena Lam, who was also so good in ""Koma"") in what at first appears to be an inexplicable situation. He is married for 20 years to Ching (the great Anita Mui, in her last role before she was cruelly taken from us), and it appears to be a loving relationship.

18822,"A rich experience is to be gained from watching this film.<br /><br />This is a seemingly simple story of a gifted pupil, Yiu Kwok, who later becomes a teacher of classical Chinese poetry. He is married with two sons, and things at home seem normal. He still loves his wife after twenty years of marriage, and his sons alternately fill him with pride (the elder one) and disappointment (the younger one).<br /><br />His passion for the poetry makes him an object of infatuation for a senior student in one of his classes. The student, Choi Lam, draws pictures of him during class, significantly, one of him with a flower coming from his mouth. She teases him more with her intelligence than her sexuality, although that too is an element. He of course is not immune to her attention, though he tries for a while to keep the demarcation line between teacher and student in place.<br /><br />The reason why he doesn't succeed in the end is complicated. Firstly there is a real depth to the communication between him and Choi Lam. It becomes clear that she genuinely likes him, and it's mutual. Secondly, there is a long-standing problem in his marriage that is brought to light when an old friend of both his and his wife becomes ill. The consequences of the wife's involvement with this friend, both past and present, are almost too sad to bear.<br /><br />Nothing is treated trivially in this film.

18823,"Let me say first off that I am a huge fan of the original series Lonesome Dove and the book it was based from. I have put off watching this sequel for the better part of 10 years due to the bad reviews I'd heard about it. If Tommy Lee Jones wasn't playing Capt. Call I didn't see the point. If Larry McMurtry wasn't involved why should I care? How wrong I was.<br /><br />This is in so many ways a worthy sequel to Lonesome Dove, maybe even more so than the dark mood of Streets Of Laredo. The story, acting, production, cinematography are all top-notch. Of course the script isn't as colorful as Lonesome Dove but it has it's moments. And, much to my surprise, there are bits of Lonesome Done in this series; the relationship between July and Clara, completely dismissed in the prequel, is brought up here almost identical to the book, a most welcome surprise. The story isn't all roses, it has it's surprises too. By far the biggest surprise is Jon Voight's interpretation of Capt. Call. While not a direct copy of Tommy Lee Jones' his is both faithful and unique to Voight's credit. The cast is fantastic all across the board, and I don't think Rick Schroeder has done a better job of acting than in this series. Oliver Reed practically steals the show here, he is superb in a role that makes you care for his character as equally as you hate him.<br /><br />It is worth it to watch this if you haven't due to bad criticisms, especially that the DVD is so affordable (I got the 2-disc set for $10.99, you can probably find it cheaper).

Great cast, great story. Most definitely a close second to Lonesome Dove. I will be purchasing this movie to add to my collection. This is the best, or at least my favorite performance by Jon Voight. He is Captain Call. Lou Gossett Jr. playing Isom Pickett is not somebody I'd mess with, he is a bad ass with perspective. William Peterson does a great job as well. Rick Schroder is back as Newt with an angst filled performance that reminds me of his stint on NYPD Blue. My only problem with this film (and it's really picking nits) is that I had the impression that Call wanted to be ""the first man to graze cattle in Montana"", and it's obvious that Dunnigan had already been there a while.

Answer: Positive"
18826,"Let me begin by saying that there is no bigger fan of the original ""Lonesome Dove"" than I. Both the Pulitzer Prize-winning book and the towering mini-series adapted from it stand alone in my experience as moving, dramatic, believable, and engrossing works. There is no comparison between ""Lonesome Dove"" and any Western film- at least not since the legendary collaborations of John Ford and John Wayne. It was with real reservations that I sat down to watch this new mini-series, what with McMurtry's non-participation, and the missing original cast members. After watching the first episode it was clear that this is no ""Lonesome Dove"". In almost every measurable way this sequel falls short of the original. But so what? I wasn't expecting it to measure up. Taken as an effort of it's own this film is engaging, entertaining and of a very good quality. If it were done as a new story, not as a sequel to ""Lonesome Dove"", there is no question in my mind that it would not have received as many negative ratings. Jon Voight did a creditable job as Call, Barbara Hershey was a terrific Clara, and the new characters like Gideon Walker and Agostina Vega were well rendered and believable. Louis Gossett jr. deserves special mention as the horse wrangler Isom Pickett. The film made me care about the characters, and I don't ask any more than that from an actor. it is unfortunate that this worthy effort stands in the shadow of it's predecessor- it is worth viewing in it's own right.",Positive,Positive,Positive,positive,"This review is a nuanced evaluation of the sequel to ""Lonesome Dove,"" a beloved book and mini-series. The reviewer, a self-proclaimed huge fan of the original, approaches the new mini-series with reservations due to the absence of the original cast members and the non-participation of Larry McMurtry, the author of the original book. Despite these concerns, the reviewer finds the new series to be ""engaging, entertaining, and of very good quality"" when considered on its own merit, rather than as a direct comparison to the original.

The reviewer praises the performances of the new cast members, including Jon Voight, Barbara Hershey, and Louis Gossett Jr., who bring the characters to life and evoke emotional investment from the viewer. The reviewer acknowledges that the sequel falls short of the original in many ways but argues that it is unfair to judge it solely by comparison. Instead, the reviewer suggests that the new series should be evaluated on its own terms, as a standalone work.

The tone of the review is balanced, acknowledging both the shortcomings of the sequel and its redeeming qualities. The reviewer's conclusion is that the series is ""worth viewing in its own right,"" implying that it has value and merit, even if it doesn't live up to the standard set by the original.

18827,"This a wonderful sequel to the award winning Lonesome Dove miniseries in the 1980's. This sequel is perhaps, better than the original. It is definitely more family friendly. The language is more subdued. There is plenty of violence and one particular scene with Cherokee Jack is particularly gruesome. However, overall a great movie. The acting is superb. William Peterson is fantastic. Such a great dramatic actor with a quick sense of wit and comic timing. Jon Voight aptly fills Tommy Lee Jones' shoes as Captain Call. Ricky Shroder gives a great heart-filled performance as the young boy who grew up with no family to claim him.

18828,"I had my reservations about watching The Return to Lonesome Dove after seeing and enjoying the original so much. Without Tommy Lee Jones reprising his role as Woodrow Call or Anjelica Huston as Clara, I figured it just wouldn't seem authentic enough. Upon viewing 'return' I can honestly say it's a worthy successor. The actors really make the show with Jon Voight, Rick Schroder, and Oliver Reed all preforming at their very best. I admit the story might not be quite as engrossing as the first, but 'return' definitely has it's share of excitement and captures the romance of the old west in a way that few other films have.

18829,"At first glance of this mini... I was a bit disappointed that Tommy Lee Jones and Anjelica Huston didn't return to the cast. Both John Voight and Barbara Hershey did commendable jobs replacing very important characters for the continuing saga of this legendary Epic Western. <br /><br />Cherokee Jack Jackson (Haysbert) played an excellent bad guy, and Louis Gossett Jr. was, as always, true to form with his excellent acting skills.<br /><br />The drama that seemed true to life in many scenes, including one of the best, where the valiant shoot-out ended with Ranger Walker being killed made me feel that I was actually in the film. Return to Lonesome Dove was to me, almost up to the quality of the first of the series. The next 2 follow ups with James Garner as Call just didn't make it for me. And that Lorena marries Pea Eye? How the heck did that get in their? That was a total mismatch of characters. The first 2 of the series made the Epic story, the next 2 in no way were of the same quality.<br /><br />Now, if the first 2 could be remastered in Dolby Digital and an Anamorphic presentation, the films could be where they should have been like the movies of today.",Positive,Positive,Positive,positive,"This review is generally positive, with the reviewer expressing satisfaction with the casting choices, particularly John Voight and Barbara Hershey, who replaced Tommy Lee Jones and Anjelica Huston.

However, the reviewer expresses some disappointment with the later installments of the series, stating that they did not live up to the quality of the first two. The reviewer specifically criticizes the plot development, such as Lorena marrying Pea Eye, which is seen as a mismatch of characters. The reviewer concludes by suggesting that remastering the first two films in Dolby Digital and anamorphic presentation would elevate them to modern standards.

Despite some criticisms, the review is overall positive, focusing on the strengths of the film, such as the performances and dramatic scenes, rather than its weaknesses.

18833,"Apart from being a clever and well-marketed variation on the nowadays hugely popular horror genre and a splendid formula to attract potential new fans in general, I always somewhat considered ""Supernatural"" as a massively giant homage towards the genre through the decades. Although not always noticeable to younger viewers and/or people who only have an interest in more recent horror films, each and every single episode contains a few obvious and subtler references towards classic and influential titles. From that point of view, it was only a matter of time before the writers would pay tribute to the 'creepy vehicle without a driver' type of films, and even more specifically the 70's milestones ""Duel"" (Steven Spielberg's acclaimed debut) and ""The Car"". Being an avid fan of these two films, I enjoyed ""Route 666"" a lot even in spite of its flaws and shortcomings. The episode opens tense and atmospherically on a remote Missourian road, where a black man is hunted down and eventually killed by a menacing monster truck with seemingly no driver behind the wheel. The victim's daughter, Cassie, happens to be Dean's ex-girlfriend and she calls the Winchester Brothers in for help. The brothers can't prevent two more similar ""accidents"" before discovering the ghost-truck sudden presence relates all the way back to a racial dispute of the 60's, involving both of Cassie's parents as well as several more prominent inhabitants of the little town. Some of my fellow reviewers around here tend to label ""Route 666"" as one of the weaker entries in season one, mainly because the script is too preachy regarding racial issues and shows a different and more emotional side of Dean's character. He's usually the strong silent type, whereas here he's confronted with unfinished romantic affairs from the past here. To a certain level I agree with the racism debate, but it didn't bother me that much, really. The writers eventually had to give an explanation to the presence of the ghost truck, and racial conflict is an acceptable one as far as I'm concerned. Concerning Dean's emotional vulnerability, I can only state it's admirable to see how the writers continuously attempt to provide depth and detail to the main characters. Dean's behavior towards Cassie sheds a whole new light on him, in fact. Besides, what really counts in this episode is the wondrously sinister truck and its virulent attacks. It's an impressive and overpowering vehicle, producing blinding lights and grisly engine noises. In case you worshiped the brilliant aforementioned ""Duel"", you will definitely find some amusement in the compelling chase sequences depicted in ""Route 666"".",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer expressing admiration for the ""Supernatural"" episode ""Route 666"" as a homage to classic horror films, particularly ""Duel"" and ""The Car"". The reviewer appreciates the episode's tense and atmospheric opening, the sinister and overpowering ghost truck, and the well-executed chase sequences. While acknowledging some flaws and shortcomings, the reviewer defends the episode's exploration of racial issues and Dean's emotional vulnerability, seeing it as an attempt to add depth to the characters.

The reviewer's enthusiasm for the episode is evident in their praise for the writers' efforts to pay tribute to classic horror films and their ability to create a sense of tension and atmosphere.

18834,"Episode No. thirteen of the fanciful (excuse the incredibly gay terminology) ""Supernatural"" TV series relocates Sam and Dean Winchester to Missouri where they have been called upon by an old flame of Dean's to investigate a string of mysterious murders occurring in their small town. As it turns out, a large pick-up truck with an unseen driver is running down African Americans on a desolate stretch of road... While Dean attempts to rekindle his past love affair, more towns people turn up as roadkill. The cause appears to be due to a past racial incident back in the 60s, causing a frustrated redneck spirit to remain in ghostly limbo, seeking to kill black motorists. ""Route 666"" is another good installment (which isn't uncommon, I've noticed) which contains a few notable aspects pertaining to the pair of main characters such as Dean getting laid and Sam's admitted regret for having left college...

18835,"This episode of Buffy was one of my personal favorites. Also number three of Joss' personal favorites as well. The episode featured very little dialogue and despite that the good folks at the Emmy's decided it merited a nomination. Unfortunately it didn't win. When Hush first premiered it received about 6 million viewers, which was the highest rated episode of season four. That should tell you something. Even though there was very little talking it managed to intrigue people enough to tune in. Those gentlemen characters (who were played my mimes) were some of the scariest creatures the show has produced (or any network TV show I've seen).

18837,"This is a good episode, but it's not my favorite. A lot of people love it and on a creative level it's brilliant. Most of the episode has no dialog, which is such a cool idea and ""Hush"" handles the silence really well. Plus, this episode introduces Tara, who I like a lot. But, I don't like Riely or the Initative or Maggie Walsh and they seem to get a lot of screen time in ""Hush."" Plus, I don't think the Gentlemen are that scary and I get tired of watching the float around Sunnydale. I know that I'm in the minority, but I tend to fast-forward parts of ""Hush."" Of course, there are other parts of the episode that I think are great, so if you're watching on DVD, I recommend seeing this episode. It really is a classic.<br /><br />""Hush"" revolves around the entire town losing their voices. Skelatal looking demon-guys called the Gentlemen arrive to gather seven hearts from human victims, but if they hear a human scream they die. So they steal the voices of everyone in town. Buffy and the Scoobies try to figure out what's going on, while the Initative also start investigating. Meanwhile, Xander comes to realize how much Anya means to him and Willow meets a fellow witch named Tara. Buffy and Riely finally come face to face while fighting the Gentlemen. They are both stunned about what they learn... He's a commando and she's the Slayer. In the end Buffy saves the day, but she now has to deal with her new knowledge of Riely's secret life.<br /><br />Really, the creativity of ""Hush"" can't be seen in a basic outline of its plot. It's the overwhelming silence of the episode, that makes it so great. The characters try to communicate in different ways, (White-out boards, pantomime, obscene finger gestures, etc...) and it all just works really well. After a while you forget that there's no dialog because they're all so good at expressing themselves. During the ""talking"" parts of the episode, there are a lot of references to the importance of really ""hearing"" each other. Anya claims that Xander won't really talk to her. Giles ignores Spike and Xander's protests and insists that Spike move into Xander's apartment. Buffy quickly substitutes the word ""petroleum"" for ""patrolling"" when she talks to Riely so she won't have to explain her calling. And then at the end, when Buffy and Riely really do learn the truth about each other, they sit there with nothing to say. It's all pretty cool.<br /><br />There are a lot of good parts to this episode. I love that people keep forgetting that they can't talk. Buffy and Xander both try to use the phone. Riley can't use the voice recognition thing in the Initatives' elevator. People try to scream. It's basically what everyone would really do if they suddenly had no speech. And I think it's hilarious that Spike has to move in with Xander. (They'll also share an apartment for a little while in season seven.) Xander and Spike have a fun bickering childishness that's just hilarious. Also I like the beginning of Tara and Willow's relationship. Tara plays an important role for the rest of the show and she and Willow are pretty cute together. It's nice to see them just starting out.<br /><br />On the downside, I don't understand how the Gentlemen are choosing their victims. They just seem to float around dorms and pick random people. Also, I don't like Riely. I've never liked him, but from ""Hush"" on I'm pretty much just waiting for Angel to come back to town and beat him up. Finally, what happens to Olivia after this? It seems like we just met her, she and Giles have a relationship, everything's going fine... and then she's suddenly dropped. I don't get it.<br /><br />My favorite part of the episode: Giles' ""Who are the Gentlemen?"" lecture to the Scoobies. The whole scene is wonderful and his over-heads are just hilarious. He makes some similar looking flashcards in season seven's ""First Date."" Pretty much anytime Giles starts drawing monsters, it's just gonna be fun.",Positive,Positive,Positive,positive,"This review is a mixed assessment of the ""Hush"" episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. While the reviewer acknowledges the episode's creative brilliance, particularly in its use of silence and non-verbal communication, they also express some criticisms and personal preferences. The reviewer praises the episode's unique concept, the introduction of Tara, and the character interactions, especially between Xander and Spike. They also appreciate the themes of communication and understanding that are woven throughout the episode.

However, the reviewer is not a fan of Riley, the Initiative, or Maggie Walsh, which affects their overall enjoyment of the episode. They also find the Gentlemen, the skeletal demons, to be less scary than others might, and get tired of watching them float around Sunnydale. Additionally, they question the Gentlemen's victim selection process and are puzzled by the disappearance of Olivia, a character introduced in this episode.

Despite these criticisms, the reviewer acknowledges that ""Hush"" is a classic episode and recommends watching it, especially for its creative and well-executed concept. They highlight the episode's ability to convey emotions and tell a story without relying on dialogue, making it a standout in the series.

18838,"Having seen the movie years ago and been disappointed by its squandered potential, when I heard that it was becoming a TV series, I flatly refused to watch it. My best friend became a rabid fan immediately, and knowing my love for horror movies, could not believe that I wouldn't watch a single episode. I told him that the movie had scarred me for life as far as anything BUFFY was concerned, and he told me to forget that the movie even existed. He insisted that I give two episodes a shot: ""Once More With Feeling"" and this one.<br /><br />Both of them are why I am a BUFFY fan today. He was right - I was hooked immediately. I have never seen a show with the guts to dare try an episode that has next to no dialogue, and nothing else could've pulled it off with the panache and the pure creativity of BUFFY.

18840,"Though not exactly a comedy in the usual sense of the word this more rewarding than any movie full of laughs but devoid of substance. I don't think Bergman's movies can be easily classed under narrow genres, even the lightest are quite complex. This movie in spite of its light touch poses a series of problems related to marriage and its shortcomings and what happens when the flames start to die etc. I don't really communicate personally with all these issues as I am sure others do. But the atmosphere of the movie is extraordinary, you almost wish it not to end. I have to admit that I was swept away by the Bergman of the fifties, having come to know most of his later, groundbreaking efforts. Before Nykvist, von Sydow, Ulman etc. the master produced some of the richest, warm and touching movies I have ever seen.

18841,"Bergman is a sublime comedy director and writer. This fact becomes apparent in ""En lektion I kärlek"", where the comic elements range from pure slapstick to deep, yet very emotional scenes. This movie is paves the way for Bergman's later comedies ""Sommarnattens leende"" and ""Kvinnodröm"", all of them starring Gunnar Björnstrand as well as Eva Dahlbeck. This is an excellent movie with which to start your Bergman experience, acutely portraying emotional troubles of the young as well as the old.

18842,"Bergman and comedy don't quite go together. Some of his comedies are so naff you almost wince. This film has the odd naff moment - the last 30 seconds being the nadir, but on the whole this is a charming (rather than funny) piece, enjoyable throughout. Bergman casts several of his usual suspects who perform well. There is a great scene on the train between David, Marianne and an uncouth salesman which will stick in the memory. Some of the marriage material is typical, cynical Bergman, but this is Bergman in a light rather than dark mood.<br /><br />This film has its moments and is worth the 90-odd minutes. Not one of his classics and not the place to start if you want to fall for Bergman.",Positive,Positive,Positive,positive,"This review is generally positive, but with some reservations. The reviewer acknowledges that Bergman's comedies can be ""naff"" (embarrassingly bad) at times, and this film is no exception, with a few cringe-worthy moments, particularly in the final 30 seconds.

The reviewer praises the performances of Bergman's regular cast members and highlights a memorable scene on a train.

18843,"A fun filled romp, full of silly if not sometimes cruel jokes. Not the best of movies, but definitely well worth watching. David Niven and Stewart Granger are their usual charming selves with Granger as an especially delightful and ingenious gentleman. Ava Gardner as wonderful as always, with such a delightful character that is absolutely iresistable. The story line is typical, but full of jocular surprises, especially concerning the unconventional relationships between Granger, Gardner and Niven.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer describing the film as a ""fun-filled romp"" that is ""well worth watching"".

18844,"Barely three and a half years after just scraping out a month's run (7-31 Oct. 1953) at Broadway's Coronet Theatre (on west 49th Street; since renamed the O'Neill), MGM relied on the earlier solid London success of the play to lavish a wonderful cast and - for the most part - carefully ""opened up"" production on a sadly trimmed down screenplay of this slyly subversive boulevard comedy and were rewarded with a modest hit.<br /><br />Ava Gardner is the increasingly frustrated wife of Stewart Granger, an internationally successful and entirely complacent ""workaholic"" (before the term had been coined) using the perpetually frustrated David Niven to attempt to rekindle passion in her spouse. When the ""second honeymoon"" cruise Gardner inveigles Granger into leaves the trio (and Granger's dog) marooned on a south sea island (were there other survivors? That's for later plot developments), Granger continues right on managing the world around him - building a big hut for himself and his wife and a little one of the title for Niven - or the unattached male.<br /><br />The core of the actual plot of the play only gets going about half way through the film when Niven proposes that Granger and he alternate as tenants of the Little Hut - sharing the only female on the island as Granger has been willing to share the only pair of shoes (his).<br /><br />Reason (which Granger considers his strong point) reigns and frustration reigns supreme - for a while.<br /><br />David Niven and Ava Gardner are superb in their appointed roles of suave would-be seducer and seductress, and Stuart Granger - usually called upon merely to be handsome and virile in action roles and the odd miscast specialty (a crowing pretty-boy as Apollodorus in Shaw's CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA in 1945) - gives one of the better acting performances of his film career as the husband who may actually be as smart as he thinks he is. 33 years later he would again show this suave urbanity opposite Rex Harrison in Granger's first (and BOTH their last) Broadway engagements in a hit revival of Somerset Maugham's THE CIRCLE which only ended with Harrison's death. We'd be far richer if Granger had used these skills more often.<br /><br />As promising as the menage is, this is, after all, a very British Boulevard Comedy AND Hollywood in the 1950's which is to say that (unlike the source play) very little sex actually goes on. To be frank, if you don't give yourself over to the ideas driving the contrivances it does get a bit silly (the same basic plot is far more satisfyingly developed three years later in the Cary Grant/Deborah Kerr/Robert Mitchum/Jean Simmons (Stewart Granger's actual wife) THE GRASS IS GREENER, based on an even less successful play, but for some reason that superior trifle failed at the box office).<br /><br />As lavishly as MGM set the piece, there were unfortunate lapses - the silliness which ends the stay on the island is cartoonishly presaged in what should have been a moment of genuine excitement - the sinking of the yacht that PUTS them on the island. Ultimately we only get about three quarters of an hour of the real Little Hut, but ninety good minutes of David Niven, Ava Gardner and Stewart Granger that make the film a fun diversion. Not high culture, but a worthy guilty pleasure.<br /><br />We even get some very nice garnish in Walter Chiari (reputed to be Ava's actual lover at the time). As one of his better speeches goes: ""Boola, boola!""",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is generally positive, but with some reservations. The reviewer praises the cast, particularly David Niven, Ava Gardner, and Stewart Granger, who deliver strong performances. The film's lavish production and clever script are also commended. The reviewer notes that the film's core plot, which revolves around a love triangle between the three main characters, only gets going halfway through the film, but still manages to be engaging. The reviewer also appreciates the film's witty dialogue and clever character interactions.

However, the reviewer also mentions some drawbacks, such as the film's toned-down approach to sex and sensuality, which is typical of Hollywood films from the 1950s. The reviewer also criticizes the film's ending, which is deemed cartoonish and silly. Additionally, the reviewer notes that the film's potential is not fully realized, and that the plot is not as satisfying as it could be.

Despite these criticisms, the reviewer concludes that the film is still a ""fun diversion"" and a ""worthy guilty pleasure."" The reviewer seems to appreciate the film's lighthearted and playful tone, and the performances of the cast.

18845,"This is a very noir kind of episode. It begins with Jim returning from a weekend trip with a new girlfriend, the recently divorced Karen Mills (Pat Delaney--daughter in law of John Huston, who knew a few things about noir film) and her daughter. When they arrive, Karen goes in the house while Jim picks up her daughter from the back seat and carries her up to her room. He then discovers Karen has disappeared without a trace. Of course he calls Dennis and when the police arrive, they see no sign of Karen, but find her next door neighbor murdered in the bushes. So of course that makes Jim an immediate suspect.<br /><br />This is a great little mystery and the first half of the story is shown by Rocky asking Jim to go over the story once again. Rocky suggests that by Jim telling him the story he might remember a little detail that he didn't think was important at the time, but now might lead to a clue as to what happened. It's a really well written scene and completes the transition of the Rocky character from a grifter to a concerned parent. It also goes a long way to show that Rocky isn't just some clueless old man either. As he says ""You come to me because I'm your father. And I'm smarter than you!"" This is one of those times where we see where Jim got his smarts.<br /><br />This episode also features an appearance by hottie Lara Parker, who played Angelique in the ""Dark Shadows"" series and went on to play Laura Banner, Bruce's wife in the ""Incredible Hulk"" series a few years later. She looks terrific here.<br /><br />This episode also marks the first mention of the Minette crime family, a name that would keep popping up on the Rockford Files almost whenever they needed a mob family. This time, its Vincent Minette who Rockford helps apprehend.<br /><br />Lt. Diehl (Tom Atkins) makes his first appearance on the series and Dennis is quietly demoted from a police lieutenant that he was on the earlier season one episodes to a police Sargent. I guess they figured it would be better to have Dennis less powerful and add some conflict between Jim and the police. Frankly, they were right, though I prefer the later Lt. Chapman to Lt. Diehl. <br /><br />Not a lot of the typical ""Rockford"" humor in this episode, but a good mystery with a lot of heart.",Positive,positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the episode's engaging mystery, well-written scenes, and character development. The reviewer appreciates the noir-inspired tone of the episode, which adds to the show's complexity and intrigue. The use of a non-linear storytelling approach, where Jim recounts the events to Rocky, is seen as a clever device to reveal clues and showcase Rocky's intelligence and concern for his son. The reviewer also highlights the episode's ability to balance mystery with character development, particularly in the relationship between Jim and Rocky.

The review also acknowledges the episode's attention to detail, such as the introduction of the Minette crime family, a recurring element in the series, and the demotion of Dennis from lieutenant to sergeant, which adds conflict to the story. The reviewer praises the performances, including Lara Parker's appearance, and notes that the episode's tone is more serious, with less of the typical ""Rockford"" humor. Overall, the review suggests that this episode is a standout, with a well-crafted mystery, strong character interactions, and a more nuanced tone.

18846,"The episode begins with scenes of a dead woman bather washed up on the shore, a forlorn Jim strolling along the beach lost in reverie and a night ride home that ends in murder and mystery. Yep,this is an atmospheric little number with a super twist at the end. Jim does well to unravel what is, a priori, an inexplicable case of a woman going missing 20 seconds after she enters her home. To be sure, the eventual explanation is a little far-fetched. Why, for example, go to the lengths of substituting a woman midway thru a car journey when simply rubbing her AND her companions out would've been as easy and left less of a trail. However, these niggles aside, it's a memorable TRF episode full of invention, even if YET AGAIN Jim gets put in the frame by an ever suspicious Police Dept. I mean to say, have the ungrateful so-and-so's ever sat down and counted just how many of THEIR files have been solved by dear ol' Jimbo?",Positive,Positive,Positive,positive,"This review is generally positive, praising the episode's atmospheric tone, engaging mystery, and memorable plot twists.

They commend Jim's detective work in unraveling the complex case, despite some reservations about the plausibility of the explanation. The reviewer's tone is conversational and humorous, poking fun at the police department's constant suspicion of Jim, implying that they should be grateful for his help in solving cases.

The reviewer's criticisms are minor, focusing on the somewhat far-fetched explanation for the mystery, but they acknowledge that these ""niggles"" do not detract from the episode's overall memorability and inventiveness. The tone is lighthearted and playful, with a touch of sarcasm, suggesting that the reviewer enjoyed the episode despite some minor flaws.

18847,"I just recently discovered this fantastic series and I just can't seem to get enough of Garner's laid back PI.

Forsaking humor in favor of a more serious turn for Rockford as he searches for his missing girlfriend.<br /><br />The mystery is great and it's unraveling is convincing enough. It's based on a book (can't remember the name) and it could easily have been stretched to a feature length episode. Garner excels here as Rockford gets tough and really means business.

The reviewer praises the mystery's convincing unraveling and notes that it could have been expanded into a feature-length episode. James Garner's performance is highlighted, showcasing Rockford's tougher side as he takes matters into his own hands. The episode's dark and moody atmosphere, reminiscent of classic film noir from the 1940s and 1950s, adds to its appeal. The reviewer concludes by stating that this is a ""really good episode"" in a ""Class A series"" and assigns it a perfect score of 10.

Answer: Positive"
18848,"'Sleight of Hand' is my favorite Rockford Files episode of the entire series. This episode shows a side of Jim Rockford that is usually ignored. To wit, Jim is genuinely in love with a beautiful woman and is shown as a father figure to her young daughter. The woman is recently divorced and she and Jim have recently returned from a weekend getaway along with the youngster. Through a strange turn of events, the woman is discovered missing after they return to her home.<br /><br />Rockford's recounting to his father, Rocky, of the events leading up to the woman's disappearance is reminiscent of Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer series from an earlier era. After much brooding and reflection and with Rocky's encouragement, Jim stumbles upon the clue that sends him off investigating the disappearance with his usual steadfastness.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Jim's girlfriend, Karen, unwittingly witnessed some mafia activity while they stayed at the Buena Vista Inn. The crime bosses responded by killing Karen and substituting another woman into Jim's car. The imposter, ostensibly asleep in the back seat, made her exit immediately upon arrival at the home. A couple of cover up murders ensue and Jim proceeds to their solution while under suspicion of the L.A. police department even as warrants are issued for his arrest.<br /><br />This episode evokes more emotional reaction than all other Rockford Files episodes combined. James Garner as Jim Rockford is seen at his most vulnerable moment and yet he retains the presence of mind to pursue the case. This is personal for Jim Rockford. In this case, he is not hired to do a job but he is trying to recover his lost love to save her life. Unfortunately, this is not possible but Jim tries hard to sort out his feelings but it is apparent that he will not soon get over his hurt.<br /><br />Despite the appeal of the main story line, many key questions are raised but never answered in this episode. (1) What becomes of the young daughter of Jim's girlfriend? (2) What did Karen actually see at the hotel that made the mafia kill her? (3) How could Jim drive for hours with an imposter in his back seat without noticing this? (4) The daughter stated that ""Mommy didn't come back with us"". So why didn't the girl scream or cry when she noticed that her mother was absent for the hours long car ride? Regardless of these ambiguities, 'Sleight of Hand"" is the Rockford Files episode which comes closest to being a tear jerker. The suspense is compelling and the story is told in a sensitive and vulnerable style which makes us feel Rockford's pain.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the ""Sleight of Hand"" episode of The Rockford Files for its emotional resonance, suspenseful storytelling, and James Garner's performance as Jim Rockford. The reviewer highlights the episode's unique portrayal of Rockford as a vulnerable and emotionally invested character, showcasing a more personal and sensitive side to his personality. The episode's ability to evoke an emotional response from the viewer is particularly noteworthy, with the reviewer stating that it evokes more emotional reaction than all other Rockford Files episodes combined.

While the reviewer does acknowledge some ambiguities and unanswered questions in the episode, these are not seen as detracting from the overall impact of the story. Instead, the reviewer focuses on the episode's strengths, including its suspenseful plot, Rockford's emotional vulnerability, and the sensitive storytelling.

18853,"One of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist, the mafia middle-man Titta Di Girolamo, a physically non-descript, middle-aged man originally from Salerno in Southern Italy. When we're introduced to him at the start of the film, he's been living a non-life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the Italian-speaking Canton of Switzerland for the last ten years, conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to. While this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the Swiss bank who normally count Di Girolamo's cash tell him that 10,000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes. At the news, he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account. Meanwhile he tells us, the spectators, that when you bluff, you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous. He says: you can't bluff for a while and then halfway through, tell the truth. Having eventually done this - bluffed only halfway through and told the truth, and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately, love - is exactly the reason behind the beginning of Titta Di Girolamo's troubles. <br /><br />This initially unsympathetic character, a scowling, taciturn, curt man on the verge of 50, a man who won't even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye, becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about. At one point in his non-life, Titta decides to feel concern about appearing ""ridiculous"". The first half of the film may be described as ""slow"" by some. It does indeed reveal Di Girolamo's days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined, deliberate pace, revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. However, scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. The existence of Titta Di Girolamo - the man with no imagination, identity or life, the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would - is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music (one theme by the Scottish band Boards of Canada especially stood out). <br /><br />Never was the contrast between the way Hollywood and Italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as Le Conseguenze dell'Amore or L'Imbalsamatore. Another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist's insomnia. Not unlike The Machinist (and in a far more explicit way, the Al Pacino film Insomnia), Le Conseguenze dell'Amore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise that's been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious, it's almost impossible to pin-point its cause (if indeed there is one). <br /><br />The young and sympathetic hotel waitress Sofia (played by Olivia Magnani, grand-daughter of the legendary Anna) and the memory of Titta's best friend, a man whom he hasn't seen in 20 years, unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that Titta eventually (though tentatively at first) accepts to look through again. Though it's never explicitly spelt out, the spectator KNOWS that to a man like Titta, accepting The Consequences of Love will have unimaginable consequences. A film without a single scene of sex or violence, a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectator's expectations, Le Conseguenze dell'Amore is a fine representative of that small, quiet, discreet Renaissance that has been taking place in Italian cinema since the decline of Cinecittà during the second half of the 70s. The world is waiting for Italy to produce more Il Postino-like fare, more La Vita è Bella-style films... neglecting to explore fine creations like Le Conseguenze dell'Amore, L'Imbalsamatore and others. Your loss, world.",Positive,positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the film ""Le Conseguenze dell'Amore"" for its unique storytelling, character development, and cinematic craftsmanship. The reviewer highlights the film's ability to transform an initially unsympathetic character, Titta Di Girolamo, into someone the audience cares deeply about. The slow-burning pace of the first half is justified by the reviewer, who argues that seemingly mundane details are essential to the film's masterful construction. The use of music, editing, and cinematography is also commended.

The reviewer draws comparisons to other films, highlighting the distinct approach of Italian cinema, particularly in its portrayal of mobsters. The film's exploration of insomnia as a symbol of deeper emotional turmoil is also praised. The reviewer appreciates the subtle, nuanced performances and the way the story unfolds at its own pace, defying spectator expectations.

The tone of the review is enthusiastic and celebratory, with the reviewer urging readers to explore this hidden gem of Italian cinema. The final sentence, ""Your loss, world,"" emphasizes the reviewer's admiration for the film and their desire to share it with a wider audience.

18854,"I saw Le Conseguenze Dell'Amore on the 2005 Rotterdam Filmfestival, It was the first of ten films I saw there.<br /><br />Le Conseguenze has left the most powerful impression of the ten films. From the first shot, you know the movie is going to be something special. The beautiful cinematography left me in awe of what can be done with a camera. The music is also on par with the visuals, complementing the colorful and stylish architecture-like images.<br /><br />Toni Servillo plays the main character in the film, Titta. He's a tax expert gone wrong who lives in a hotel. Every week, he brings a suitcase with money to a bank and the story plays around this.<br /><br />He is always very controlled and shows almost no emotion to anyone; Looks calculated and well-dressed.

Although she's been working in the hotel for two years, he never greets her, even if she does greet him. On one day she confronts him with this and the next day he sits at the bar, instead of his usual spot at a window. From here the story really begins, and will unfold in a strong tale of love, sacrifice and the mafia.<br /><br />I won't spoil the rest of the film.

The reviewer notes that the story unfolds into a powerful tale of love, sacrifice, and the mafia, but refrains from spoiling the rest of the film.

The reviewer concludes by recommending the film to those who appreciate stylish and atmospheric cinema, citing David Lynch and The Godfather as references. The only caveat is that the film may not be suitable for action enthusiasts.

18855,"There are movies that are just a different version of another one, not remakes, but just similar to others, it is not. Although it talks about Mafia it is watched in another way and often it seems just a secondary theme. I went to watch that movie for case (because the otherone's theatre was full) and I was satisfied at the end. It surprised me, because of its black irony or cynicism and there are more and more interesting items to analyze. It doesn't follow the classical ways of movies, it is just different and I think not to be the only one to like that. I am very happy also because it is Italian, and I was afraid that Italian directors and producers were not enough brave to change themes. In this movie you can watch new Italian style as well, but is not blocked into clichés. I hope to be understandable enough, I know it is difficult, I hope also that this movie can be exported out of our frontiers, it is a good product to export. I want to point out also the music, very good soundtrack, the movie needs it because of its long silent pause and they are covered perfectly by that music.

18856,"The consequences of love: There is really something special about this film but it's very hard to put your finger on. It is a love story of sorts but not really one i've seen before. It has several love themes running throughout the film. One mans love for a younger woman, a younger mans love for his older brother, the mafias love of money at all costs these are just some that intertwine in a story that has you guessing or rather not knowing where and how it will end. The cast are all superb from Sophia the teasing barmaid to the straight faced-ness of titta the films central character. With simple yet affective camera work bounced off an ever-changing soundtrack that mixes low-fi trip hop with lush orchestral pieces.

18857,"I saw this movie in the Rotterdam Film Festival and I was pleasantly surprised. The photography is just so stylish and beautiful, and the story it's just not your average mafia movie, actually that storyline is pretty much in the background. It's more the personal journey of a middle age man that is trapped in an existence he was forced to live. The actor, Toni Servillo, is superb, he excels this ""quiet man"". The girl, Olivia Magnani, is the grand-daughter of Italian actress Anna Magnani and lives up to the family surname.<br /><br />If you're expecting your typical Italian movie where everybody is screaming to each other in big families, this is NOT your movie.

18858,"Although I totally agree with the previous comment regarding the marvellous acting of Toni Servillo as Titta Di Girolamo, I would also like to add the beautiful filming and montage which turns this movie virtually into a painting. The young director Paolo Sorrentino had the courage to experiment with different types of camera techniques which reminded me of Darren Aronofsky' Requiem for a Dream. They both used the same MTV-style filming combined with modern (alternative/techno) music, making the film  Le Consequenze dell'Amore - stand apart from the other crime/mafia movies in its genre. Even though the movie may start of very slow-paced almost ""sec"" compared to the faster Hollywood productions it should be enjoyed cause of its serenity, marvellous character portray and splendid ending.

18859,"This is a very visual film. By that I mean that the dialog is sparse, almost to the point of being a silent movie for some very long takes, beginning with the opening shot.<br /><br />The silences, however, are broken by a stunning sound track that ranges from discordant, staccato beats to a haunting mix of violins, and interspersed with vocals that sound like dreams. It's a feast for the ears as much as for the eyes, one of the early visuals being a man walking along a street, so preoccupied with his interest in a shapely woman, that he walks into a lamppost: one of the consequences of love and a metaphor for what lies in store...<br /><br />A long time ago, another movie  Love Story (1970) -- said that love is never having to say you're sorry. This narrative turns that idea on its head in a number of ways, beginning with the main character, Titta (Toni Sevillo), a seemingly innocuous long-term resident in a plush hotel somewhere in Switzerland. Everyday, week in, week out, he sits at the same coffee table, enjoying the passing world, his cigarettes, his coffee, his solitude  and he's been doing it for ten years. He sits, he observes, and once a week he engages in three very surprising activities that you'll find out about when you see this little masterpiece...<br /><br />Love is explored in another way, in a direct counterpoint to Titta's solitude and reserved nature: two older residents of the hotel are still much in love, but the man wants to die in a spectacular manner when his time comes, while his long suffering wife berates him for cheating at cards with the other guests, one of whom is Titta. Now, Titta knows about their squabbles, their love, the man's cheating, his apologies to his wife, and his whining. How? In a surprising and black-comedic manner...one of those surprise activities I mentioned.<br /><br />But, this is no comedy, in reality, although it does touch upon the idea of the human comedy in a Balzacian sense: the irony of life and what to do with it. That decision had been made for Titta ten years earlier when he left his wife and began to live in the hotel. He keeps in touch occasionally, and it is clear that he still loves his children (now grown up) and the sorrow in his voice speaks volumes. But, there's something more than just sorrow...<br /><br />Such a life as Titta's would obviously seem to be utterly boring, and it actually is from many perspectives. It is only when we learn what lies beneath his almost death-like countenance, however, that the horror of his situation hits the viewer between the eyes. But not before we know that the female bartender, Sofia (Olivia Magnani), is very interested in Titta and goes out of her way to pique Titta's interest in her.<br /><br />And that's when things start to unravel for Titta: he eventually succumbs to her femininity and in doing so discovers, once again, the consequences of love. Ironically, in doing so, he finally realizes what he must finally do with his life, and in a most spectacular fashion.<br /><br />I know that all of the above is somewhat cryptic; but, to say more would spoil the film and story for you. If you like Italian cinema  I love it!  I urge you to see this one. The acting is superb; the sound track chills the spine; the camera work is truly innovative; the direction shows the maturity of a true artist.<br /><br />I know I'll see this movie again, and again...",Positive,positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the film's unique visual and auditory qualities.

18860,"OK, I'm Italian but there aren't so many Italian film like this. I think that the plot is very good for 3/4 of the film but the final is too simple, too predictable. But it's the only little mistake. The Consequences of Love in my opinion have great sequences in particular at the beginning and great soundtrack. I'd like very much the lighting work on it. The best thing on it is a great, great actor. You know, if your name were Al Pacino now everybody would have still been talking about this performance. But it's only a great theater Italian actor called Toni Servillo.

18863,"I saw this the week it opened four years ago and I really did not know what to expect being unfamiliar with Sorrentino's work at the time. He has created a very intriguing and ultimately moving account of an odd character, one for whom the phrase 'life is for living' no longer applies. It outwitted me at every turn and I was constantly surprised by the story. I enjoyed the pacing very much and the way I was gradually given the pieces to work out what was happening. Tony Servillo is superb, as is Magnani. It opens with a brilliantly stylish wide shot and concludes with a very moving image that takes the movie into sublime territory. I thought long afterwards about the main character and the position he was in and his final fate and I didn't shake it for weeks. I recently bought the film and that final scene where he thinks about his friend gets me every time. I still have yet to talk to anyone who has seen this.

18868,"Le conseguenze dell'amore (2004)is a beautifully made film that takes small carefully positioned steps towards its ending that need to be savoured in order to be enjoyed. From the contrasting landscapes, to the tightly enclosed world that the hero inhabits, we are taken by the Director and controlled from the very moment we enter the hotel. We, like the hero, will never escape from the suffocating intensity and paradoxical monotony of his criminally driven, Mafia world. That the film resists Mafia stereotypes whilst revelling in them makes it all the more successful. The concrete grave, the inevitable brutal executions and overwhelming maleness are laid bare and exposed for what they are. Just brutality and business, and no more. Life is about being part of the corporate machine that is organised crime and not about love or living for self, family or others. Our hero is indeed a hero in that he gives up his life for the sake of the touch of the beautiful barmaid, the resolution of the misery suffered by his only neighbours in the hotel and in order to escape his decorative prison.

18869,"The opening shot of the Consequences of Love perfectly sets up this intriguing and absorbing film. A travellator slowly carries a solitary out of focus figure towards the camera, trailing a huge suitcase behind him. Like the central character in the film, we know nothing of him and our initial interpretation of him, his profession, the contents of the suitcase could be way off the mark.<br /><br />Consequences of Love is that kind of film. From the title you might expect a Bergmanesq dissection of a relationship. What we have instead is a lead character, Titta, living life in emotional exile, seemingly choosing to cut himself off from those around him. If the film can be classified in any way, I would call it a mystery, as we are engaged in working out who Titta is and what he is about. What we know from the start is he is 50'ish, cool, composed and expensively attired. He has lived for the last eight years in a plush looking Swiss hotel, always paying his room fee on time but seldom showing any interest in the staff or other guests.<br /><br />His only real companions are a couple who he plays occasional card games with. The couple, it transpires, used to own the hotel but have now gambled everything away and have only the room they live in left. Their love of money, antiques and each other was their undoing and Titta seems to identify with their plight. He once had it all, but now is now living as a virtual prisoner in the hotel. His brother, a long haired surf instructor, drops in to see him occasionally, but he sees his visits as more of an intrusion than a pleasure. They talk about the person Titta considers to be his best friend, even though he hasn't seen him for 25 years. This long lost friend is now a telephone engineer, repairing the communication network that brings so many together. Meanwhile Tittas phone calls to his wife and children end quickly when they refuse to speak to him.<br /><br />Midway through the film Titta makes an uncharacteristic move and begins to open up to a young barmaid from the hotel. With his judgement clouded by emotion he sets himself on a course of actions that will ultimately seal his fate for good.<br /><br />The slow unfolding of Tittas fall from grace is and beautifully scripted, shot and scored. The thumping techno soundtrack does much to build up the tension as more and more secrets are revealed, the final half hour turning into a taught thriller as Titta lets his mask slip and must once again face the consequences of his actions. The ending, with a visual nod to Felini, is dramatic yet ambiguous and leaves the audience to once more question his motives.<br /><br />Patrick Bliss, 01/06/06",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the film ""Consequences of Love"" for its intriguing and absorbing narrative, beautiful cinematography, and well-crafted script.

18870,"I saw this interesting film back to back with the Chinese/French film ""2046"" at the recent Dubai Film festival. Both were intelligent works made the same year (2004/2005). Both had the main characters living in a ""hotel"". In both films, the hotel is more a metaphor of exile than a location. Both dealt with love between a man and a woman. Both had wonderful music and riveting performances. What a coincidence and yet how the two films differ in treatment of the subject! Somewhere at the beginning of the film, a man walking on a pavement turns to look at a woman and in doing so hits a lamp post. The audience erupts into a volcano of laughter innocently. But isn't that brief shot the synopsis of the film, that entertains you for 2 hours? While the film is a wonderful blend of black comedy (e.g., using a stethoscope to listen to neighbor's conversation), the film builds on what Buster Keaton and Jacques Tati had introduced to cinema earlier--stoic faces that leads to comedy quite in contrast to the equally intelligent world of Robin Williams or the heartwarming Danny Kaye. A sudden frenzy of activity transforms an otherwise stoic character while moving money from the hotel to the bank is reminiscent of Tati's works.<br /><br />But the film is not mere comedy. The anti-automation statement (cash counting and the reaction of the bank staff to the statements relating to it, the dummy that acts as an ineffectual warning to the speeding lady, the reference to ""Moulimix"" as the fictitious ""company"" he works for, etc.) are several cues that the director is offering a loaded comedy to the viewer. Laugh, yes, but reflect on it and enjoy further..<br /><br />The movie's strength lies in is brief, staccato script (by director Paul Sorrentino) that offers comedy that is mixed with philosophy (""Truth is boring,"" ""Dad is dead, but nobody told him,"" ""Bad luck does not exist--it is the invention of the losers and the poor"". Then the director goes on to provide you with a fascinating lecture from the main character on insomniacs. You will not sleep through this lecture.<br /><br />Sorrentino provides entertainment pegged to the subject the Italians know best--the Mafia. It is an existential mafia film.<br /><br />Since ""Truth is boring"", the director provides a dessert as part of the fine meal of superb acting (Toni Servillo), good music, clever camera-work (Luca Bigazzi), a beautiful, enigmatic actress (Magnani, grand-daughter of the great Anna) and powerful script. The dessert is for the viewer to figure out whether what preceded in the film was the truth. It would have been boring, if it was, wouldn't it?",Positive,positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the film for its unique blend of comedy, philosophy, and social commentary. The reviewer notes the film's clever script, impressive performances, and clever camera work, which all contribute to a thought-provoking and entertaining experience. The film's use of satire and absurdity is highlighted, particularly in its portrayal of the mafia and its commentary on automation and modern society. The reviewer also appreciates the film's ability to balance humor and depth, making it a ""loaded comedy"" that rewards reflection and attention.

The review is full of enthusiasm and admiration for the film's craftsmanship, with the reviewer drawing comparisons to the works of Buster Keaton and Jacques Tati. The film's themes of existentialism, morality, and the search for truth are also highlighted, and the reviewer praises the director's ability to balance these heavy themes with humor and wit. The review concludes by noting that the film's ending is intentionally ambiguous, leaving the viewer to ponder the nature of truth and reality.

18871,"The movie is a really well made one, which is great and looking and passionately directed. You can tell that every shot is thought over and executed to perfection. For the lovers of cinema this is especially a great watch and they especially should be able to appreciate the beauty of it and the passion for cinema that is being put into it.<br /><br />It's hard to place this movie under one label. It's not really a drama, it's not really a thriller and it's not really a comedy. Instead its more a movie with its own style, that does things its own way. It doesn't necessarily follow the rules of cinema and features many different elements from many different genres combined.<br /><br />But just like the movie its main character, the movie gets sort of slow and boring in parts. The artistic style of directing tries to conceal that the story is actually a quite simple one and it's more as if the movie relied solely on its style and overall atmosphere created by the movie. It doesn't make the movie horrible or anything but it just prevents it from being a true absolute must-see. In parts the movie also feels as if it's trying to be too poetic and tries to let the images speak too much for itself. It just feels a bit overdone in parts, though for most part of the movie it still works out beautifully.<br /><br />It features some great camera-work and some unique storytelling, which makes this an original as well as a great film to watch.<br /><br />7/10",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is generally positive, but with some criticisms.

18872,"Someone on these Boards has predicated that the whole thing is being dreamed by the best friend of the protagonist, albeit a friend he hasn't seen for some 20 years. I'm reluctant to dismiss this out of hand but it does raise some viable questions. Why WOULD a telephone engineer - or a shoe salesman or butcher for that matter - WANT to create a mythical world and weave it around a friend populating it in the process with a set of equally mythical supporting characters. With an imagination that good the friend should be WRITING not Dreaming. Dream or not SOMEONE, and the obvious candidate is director Paolo Sorrentino, has created a very watchable world in which Tony Servillo makes stillness a Fine Art. We are asked to believe that forty-something Titta La Girolomo (Servillo) 'upset' the Mafia some years prior to our meeting him and as penance he is a virtual prisoner in a small Swiss hotel from which each week he drives to a local bank with a suitcase containing nine mill large in used notes. Other than this weekly trip he is free to do as he likes and what he likes to do is smoke, play cards with a man who cheats and a wife who reminds the husband how far they have fallen socially, and ignore the friendly overtures of Olivia Magnani, who has spent two years trying to get a smile and/or a 'good evening' out of him. For reasons best known to himself and which are inconsistent with a man who has no interest in anything or anyone, Servillo spends a certain amount of time every day applying a stethoscope to the wall of his bedroom and listening to the private conversations of his card-playing partners. Eventually he does respond to Magnani - he has to do so or they would be no film. This is plot 6f: the one about Destry, who never wears a gun, or Sean (Duke Wayne), the 'Quiet Man' who refuses to rise to provocation and fight until the obligatory scene where the gun is strapped on and the fists cocked - but instead of contenting himself with a polite come stai oggi he removes 100,000 from the suitcase and buys her a car. The final inconsistency occurs when Magnani tells him she will pick him up the following day at 4 pm in her car and they will drive into the mountains to celebrate his birthday. We've established that she lives locally so why she is then seen driving from somewhere miles away, ignoring a police roadblock to drive off the road and overturn the car is anyone's guess. This inconsistencies apart this remains a fine piece of film-making with an excellent lead performance and a very good supporting one.",Positive,Positive,Positive,positive,"This review is generally positive, despite the reviewer's criticisms and questions about the film's plot and character motivations. The reviewer is impressed by the film's world-building, calling it ""a very watchable world"" and praising the lead performance of Tony Servillo, who ""makes stillness a Fine Art."" The reviewer also appreciates the supporting performance of Olivia Magnani. However, the reviewer raises several questions about the plot, character motivations, and inconsistencies in the story. They wonder why the protagonist, Titta La Girolomo, would engage in certain behaviors, such as listening to private conversations through a stethoscope, and why Olivia Magnani's character would drive from a distant location to pick up Titta, ignoring a police roadblock, and then overturn the car.

Despite these criticisms, the reviewer concludes that the film is ""a fine piece of film-making"" with excellent performances. The tone of the review is analytical and inquiring, with the reviewer seeking to understand the characters' motivations and the plot's inconsistencies. However, the reviewer's overall assessment is positive, acknowledging the film's strengths in world-building and performances.

18873,"I've read that Paolo Sorrintino's inspiration for The Consequences of Love came from simply observing a businessman alone in a Brazilian hotel, and speculating what he might be doing there. The film unfolds to us in a similar way. We view the existence of Titta who has lived alone in a hotel in Switzerland for 8 years. He is secretive and avoids friendship. His life is dominated by order and regularly. Gradually, the truth of his existence is revealed to us until, finally, his world begins to fall apart.<br /><br />The mystery of Titta is central to The Consequences of Love and it works thanks in large part to the superb performance by Toni Servillo. His character becomes all the more intriguing to us as little details are revealed - that he injects heroin once a week, that he has no imagination. Although some here criticise the dialogue for not being naturalistic, that doesn't matter in my view - this is not that sort of film, and I think the script is great. The camera work is also excellent.<br /><br />If you have to criticise, the film does lose its way a in the later scenes as the mystery of Titta's existence is revealed to us, and as his world begins to fall apart. However, the tragic final scenes are every bit as good as the earlier build-up.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer praising various aspects of Paolo Sorrentino's film ""The Consequences of Love"".

The reviewer highlights Servillo's superb performance, which adds to the character's mystique. The script and camera work are also commended, with the reviewer arguing that the dialogue, although not naturalistic, serves the film's unique tone and atmosphere.

The only criticism mentioned is that the film loses its way slightly in the later scenes, as the mystery is resolved and Titta's world begins to fall apart. However, the reviewer notes that the tragic final scenes are just as effective as the earlier build-up, suggesting that the film recovers from any minor missteps. Overall, the review conveys a deep appreciation for the film's unique storytelling, atmospheric tension, and strong performances.

18877,"Along with In the Army!, this ranks as one of Pauly Shore's best movies, if there is such a thing. While the whole West Coast-meets- Midwest-culture-clash isn't anything new, this film proves to make the story a little more entertaining with the wild and unpredictable antics of a then fresh Shore. While the change in values probably would have gone in the other direction, the whole concept was rather entertaining. Not only was Shore's interaction with the family hilarious, it also had Carla Gugino and Tiffani- Amber Theissen (she'll always have the Amber in my book) in two ravishing and early roles.

18881,"Despite myself, I really kinda like this movie. Pauley Shore is invariably laugh-out-loud funny, and here is no exception.

18885,"This was such a funny movie, which was soon forgotten about, probably because there are so many teen and young adult comedies, such as this. The movie is not quit as predictable as one would think. Crawl is an unattractive, but fun and caring and most importantly a very devoted friend. Still, an unlikely match for Rebecca, who has an attractive and seemingly kind boyfriend back home. When he helps feel more at ease at school, by showing her around the neighborhood and encouraging her to socialize more, they become buddies, but it is completely platonic. When she realizes her boyfriend might propose, she does not feel ready, he seems to like her boyfriend, but she seems to be enjoying her free laid back party life at college is not yet ready to live a life of marriage and responsibility. You kind of learn what a good friend Crawl is when he tells her he will help get her out of getting married. When her boyfriend proposes to her, in front of the whole family, she kicks Crawl and puts him on the spot. He tells the whole family that he proposes to her, and gives her his diamond ring, which it tunrs out was his the whole time (he must have come from money or something. Well they never really show a close up of the ring). The message of the movie seemed to be not to judge people by their looks and not to judge people before you get to know him. Rebecca's boyfriend, who her parents love, turned mean when we find out he druged his new girlfriend after Rebecca,(Amber Thesan) and Crawl, so that Rebecca would have broken up with Crawl, thinking they were a couple. Although they were not, Rebecca was mad at him, which when you think about it, was kind of unfair, since they were not a couple, but I think they were starting to like one another. And I think she thought there was more. The movie never showed them actually become a couple, they left it open for the viewers to decide. They never even actually kissed at any point, although there was one part where they almost did. That was one thing most viewers seemed to misunderstand. Many people saw it and said, that he would be a nightmare for fathers to see their daughters bring home or a shock, but they were just friends the whole time, even towards the end. And she did not introduce him as her boyfriend; still they never told her parents they were not engaged. Rebecca almost did. Even if he would never become her boyfriend, they could have still been friends. In the 90s for some reason femanin men were in, and there was this big stereo type that woman liked femanin men (not that there is anything wrong with that), think it came from the fact that women like the kind sensitive type, which Crawl proved to be, through his friendship with Rebecca. but when I saw the movie, I must admit, if I went for looks, I thought I would have gone for the first boyfriend.

18893,"By 1952 Hollywood decided to remake the Al Jolson first-talking classic.<br /><br />This time the Cantor's son was played by Danny Thomas. Coming home from the army, it is expected that he follow in the footsteps of his father and other male relatives by becoming a cantor. However, young Mr. Golding has quite a zest for show business.<br /><br />At this time, he meets Peggy Lee, an aspiring singer. She acts very well and her rendition of her favorite song, Lover, is remarkable. The film writers were smart not to plug the obvious Jewish guy and non-Jewish girlfriend relationship. If anything, this is glossed over. In his anger, for betraying his pledge to become a cantor, his father makes the traditional Jewish sign indicative of a loss in the family. This would not be done under circumstances of breaking a pledge, it would be done if among the orthodox, an inter-faith marriage would take place.<br /><br />Thomas does a really good job of playing the cantor's son. His singing is up to par as the film ends on a positive note.<br /><br />Am surprised that technical advisers did not realize that women do not carry pocketbooks into synagogue on the sabbath or at all during that period.",Positive,Positive,Positive,positive,"This review provides a mixed assessment of the 1952 remake of ""The Jazz Singer"". On the positive side, the reviewer praises Danny Thomas's performance as the cantor's son, noting that his singing is ""up to par"". Additionally, the reviewer commends Peggy Lee's acting and singing, particularly her rendition of ""Lover"". The reviewer also appreciates that the film avoids exploring the obvious conflict of an interfaith relationship between the Jewish protagonist and his non-Jewish love interest.

However, the review also points out some inaccuracies and oversights. The reviewer notes that the film's portrayal of Jewish customs and traditions is not entirely accurate, citing the example of women carrying pocketbooks into the synagogue, which would not have been done during that period. Furthermore, the reviewer questions the film's depiction of the traditional Jewish sign of mourning, which is used in the film in a context that is not traditionally accurate.

Despite these criticisms, the review concludes on a positive note, suggesting that the film ultimately ends on a high note. Overall, the review provides a balanced assessment of the film's strengths and weaknesses.

Answer: Positive"
18894,"To be frank, this is probably the best version in my book as a sound movie version of the Jazz Singer. The 1927 version is really a silent movie despite its build-up as the first talkie.<br /><br />Danny Thomas is a great comedian, and he sings very well. He does the Jewish stuff with feeling. Peggy Lee is great and any film that has her is always entertaining. Allan Joslyn is not too entertaining and we could have done without him. One question: since when do Cantors live in such luxurious houses???",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is generally positive, with the reviewer expressing their admiration for the 1952 version of ""The Jazz Singer"" starring Danny Thomas.

18895,"The Jazz Singer is one of a number of films made in the late 1940's and 1950 about the Jewish experience in the United States. Other than Crossfire(1947) and Gentleman's Agreement(1947) which dealt with anti-semitism they usually had a musical-theatre background. These films included The Jolson Story(1946), Jolson Sings Again(1949), The Eddy Duchin Story(1951), The Eddie Cantor Story(1953),The Benny Goodman Story(1956) and Margorie Morningstar(1958). The leading actors in these ""Jewish"" films were always played by non-Jews. For example Larry Parks a non-Jew played Al Jolson and Gene Kelly played Noel Airman in Marjorie Morningstar. This casting was probably done to make the Jewish theme palpable to a mainly non-Jewish audience. The Jazz Singer(1952) is no different. Danny Thomas was a devout Catholic and Peggy Lee was certainly not Jewish although she plays a non-practicing Jewess in the film. The clue to her background is when she attends the Golding's family meal before entering she says ""I haven't been to a sader (passover service) since I left home"".<br /><br />The film is about a cantor's son who has just left the service after seeing action in Korea. His dilemma is whether to become a cantor, a family tradition or to be a singer in musical theatre. His choice of theatre leads to an inevitable conflict with his father.<br /><br />However, there is much more to this film than this. This film was made after the Rosenberg trial during the McCarthy whitchhunts and the Hollywood blacklist. Therefore in this film the Jews are shown as good loyal citizens and<br /><br />are quintessentialy American. The synagogue choir would rather play baseball than practice. The cantors friends also talk about baseball in fact one of them is a Major League umpire. The synagogue itself dates back to 1790 and George Washington is said to have visited. Therefore Jews are presented as part and parcel of American society. Nobody in this film has a Eastern European accent. Peggy Lee appeared in very few feature films. In this film you get to see her sing ""Lover"" and ""Just One of Those Things"" wonderful. Danny Thomas is quite credible and he acts and sings the part very well. The comedic routines could have been left out. Yes, the film is schmaltzy and sentimental but it is well worth seeing. I enjoyed it very much.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review provides a thoughtful analysis of the 1952 film ""The Jazz Singer,"" placing it within the context of other films of the late 1940s and 1950s that explored the Jewish experience in the United States. The reviewer notes the interesting casting choice of non-Jewish actors in leading roles, likely intended to make the Jewish theme more relatable to a non-Jewish audience. The film's narrative revolves around a cantor's son struggling to choose between following in his father's footsteps or pursuing a career in musical theatre, leading to an inevitable conflict with his father.

Beyond the central plot, the reviewer highlights the film's significance in the context of the McCarthy era and the Hollywood blacklist. The film presents Jews as loyal American citizens, emphasizing their integration into American society. The reviewer appreciates the performances of Danny Thomas and Peggy Lee, particularly her singing of ""Lover"" and ""Just One of Those Things."" While acknowledging the film's sentimental and schmaltzy nature, the reviewer concludes that it is still worth watching and enjoyable.

Hopefully nobody understood a word, not there's anything to understand in this movie anyways! Haahaa! Call me a nut, but I think this is one of the best movies ever. Why would I come to that conclusion?? Because it's my national pasttime to sabotage horrible films and this one begs for it every other minute! Once I became a fan of Myster Science Theater 3000, I had no doubt in my mind they'd find it somewhere and use it. Sure enough! The version they acquired was entitled ""Cave Dwellers"" using some strange intro footage not even from the film itself (apparently, they were ashamed to use footage from their OWN film!).

18906,"In a sport that prizes quirkiness and treasures it's characters, one of the greatest of them from the 1930s was pitcher Dizzy Dean. He was so colorful a personality he was probably elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on the strength of that as opposed to his pitching statistics. After all part of the Dean story is that early end to his career.<br /><br />In the Pride of St. Louis Dan Dailey successfully captures the character of Dizzy Dean, at least the Dean I remember. I'm not old enough to remember him pitching, but I do remember him broadcasting Baseball Game of the Week during the 1960s. For that's part of the Dean story as well, being a pioneer broadcaster on radio and later television. Now that announcers are in the Hall of Fame, there's no question Dizzy belongs there.<br /><br />Jerome Herman Dean was one of a tribe of sharecropper's kids who had very little schooling, but an amazing talent for throwing a baseball at blinding speed. In fact he had a younger brother Paul Dean who was a pretty good pitcher himself.<br /><br />Richard Crenna plays Paul in this film and it's one of his earliest film roles. Paul Dean in real life was a quiet retiring sort who's career was also cut short by injuries. Because of that Crenna isn't given much to work with. During the Dean heyday, sportswriters tried to pin the nickname of Daffy on Paul, but it never took. <br /><br />Joanne Dru, taking a break from playing, western gals in gingham dresses and corsets is first rate as the wise, patient, and understanding Patricia Nash who met and married Dizzy while he was playing for Houston in the Texas League. <br /><br />In the 1937 All Star Game Dizzy started for the National League. Facing Cleveland's Earl Averill, Dean was hit on the foot by a line drive smack at him. Refusing to listen to medical advice, Dean came back to pitch too early. He'd broken a big toe and put too much of a strain on his arm. He was never the same pitcher and his refusal to accept that is part of the story. <br /><br />Had he had a career of say ten to fifteen years who knows what pitching statistics he might have rolled up. Dean was the next to last pitcher to win 30 games in 1934 and after Denny McLain(who was something of a character himself)did it 1968 it hasn't been done since.<br /><br />Dean went into broadcasting and while he was not the first former player to go into the broadcast booth, his colorful game descriptions made him an instant hit. He started broadcasting for the other St. Louis team, the Browns, and the Browns were a pretty miserable team with not much to cheer about. Dean became a star attraction there.<br /><br />Of course part of the Dean story is the trouble he got into because of his lack of education and his colorful way of expressing himself on the air. That's part of the story I won't go into, but in the film it's handled with tact and humility and your eyes might moisten if you tend to the sentimental.<br /><br />A fine baseball film, a real tribute to an American success story.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the film ""The Pride of St. Louis"" for its portrayal of Dizzy Dean, a legendary baseball player and broadcaster.

18907,"Dan Dailey gives a sincere and colorful performance as the great Dizzy Dean. His handling of the character is very true to life and captures the flavor of Dean's background and limited education. The film of course centers around Dizzy Deans rise to fame and his sudden trip to the sidelines with an injury he chose to ignore, much to his regret. His wife is splendidly portrayed by Joanna Dru who gives a very down to earth quality to the woman who loved and supported the ballplayer who rose to a ""dizzying height"" so quickly. The portrayal of Dizzy's later career as a sportscaster is honest and unflinching, reflecting his troubles which stemmed from his poor education and his colorful language both on and off the air. Dizzy was quite a character and Daily has breathed life into his story with admirable skill. If you enjoyed this film, I recommend the comedy ""Kid from Left Field"" (1953) wherein Daily plays a down and out has-been ballplayer idolized by his young son (Billy Chapin). Daily again fleshes out a ballplayer in a completely satisfying manner. I heartily recommend Pride of St. Louis to baseball fans everywhere.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the performances of Dan Dailey and Joanna Dru in the biographical film about Dizzy Dean's life.

The film's honest portrayal of Dean's struggles, including his injury and later career as a sportscaster, is also praised.

18909,"Wonderful family film that should be a staple at Christmas time. It's a mystery to me why it isn't. A true lost film that I first encountered, flickering away on my old 19"" black and white RCA, when the Million Dollar Movie was still in vogue on Channel 9 in New York City. This Rudolph Mate directed fantasy should be nestled under everyone's Christmas tree. But it has never been released on home video. Too bad. I believe I saw part of it on AMC a few years ago, before they cut many of their older films from the rotation. TCM should take up the slack and play it at Easter or on Christmas Eve. Any movie with Santa, Aunt Bee, the Hostess Cupcake Lady, and an actor with the first name King, can't be bad. Ann Blyth as ""Sally"" is a bundle of energy. During her school years, she rushes over to the chapel to pray for St. Ann to help and give guidance to her mixed-up and financially strapped family. It works. So, after she graduates, she places a statue of St. Ann in her own bedroom. At one point the entire O'Moyne residence is moved to another address. I think this was done to put an end to a neighbor dispute between the O'Moynes and the dastardly fellow next door. Blyth is cute as a button. Edmund Gwen can play the reclusive grandfather in his sleep. All-in-all, this is a satisfying movie experience.",Positive,Positive,Positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, expressing a deep affection for the film and a sense of nostalgia.

18910,"This film centered on a young lady who makes prayers to help her family and friends when they encounter difficulties in life. It made me think of other movies like the ""Song of Bernadette"" and ""Francis of Assisi"" and has a very strong Catholic faith influence in the film. Ann Blyth is very charming as first, the Catholic school student and then later as a young woman who buys a statue of Saint Anne (which is the name of the street that I live on, by the way) and makes many prayers for the saint's intercession whenever problems come up in her life. Frances Bavier (Aunt Bea from the Andy Griffith show) and Edmund Gwenn (from Miracle on 34th Street) play relatives of her.

18911,"I watched this movie a long time ago, but I've always loved it. The story is about a young girl, Sally O'Moyne who finds out at a young age that when she prays to St. Anne, her prayers are answered, hence her missing lunch pail and a mean neighbor who tattles on her and she prays, that someone should give him a black eye for tattling. Well, a minute later something hits him and he has a black eye. Sally then believes in the power of prayer and decides to use that power for good. She is well known and loved around the neighborhood as she has copybooks/journals filled with all her friends requests to St. Anne.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a local boy returns home from college (I believe) and Sally is awestruck at how much he's grown-up. Sally has a huge crush on him, but is so shy. Should she use her power of prayer to St. Anne for her own selfish desire or just watch as the most popular girls in school try to snare the man of her dreams? This is a fun filled movie with a grandfather who is so charming and Irish, brother's who are hilariously annoying and a sworn Irish neighbor-enemy who spars with grand-pop on an everyday basis. He has his own story of wanting to buy the O'Moynes property which is a little house in the middle of two huge apartment complexes (his own), in other words, the O'Moynes house is an eye-sore to his lovely buildings.<br /><br />This movie is definitely worth a watch and is good enough and rare enough to add to your movie collection.

My Mom knew this, so she told me to watch this with her. I did, and have seen it many times since because it is really funny. Aunt Bea from the Andy Griffith Show was in it and Sally's grandfather was the guy who played Santa Claus in Miracle On 34th Street. So, there were lots of actors we seen on TV shows too. There is a bad guy who keeps trying to steal the house away, and Sally keeps trying things with St. Anne to help raise money so they can keep the house.

18914,"""Miss Cast Away"" is an amusing trifle, which dispenses with serious plot or character development to pack in as many gags as possible. Best enjoyed with a large audience that is open to such entertainments and perhaps, has had a few drinks. Most of the jokes are current-event based so in future years this film may become a time-capsule of turn-of-the-21st-century pop culture references.<br /><br />The 30i to 24p conversion of the footage does create a jerky appearance in some parts, most noticeably the opening aerial shots.<br /><br />The appearance of Micheal Jackson is indeed a strange non-sequiter event. But I, for one, find it encouraging that Mr. Jackson has shown a helpful interest in one of his protégés even after he (the director) has passed from the cute-preteen-boy stage.<br /><br />The effects work is not as bad as one review suggested. Most of it was done by a one-man crew in a brief span of time consisting of animator William Sutton, whose name seems to have been omitted from the IMDb credits. His work is an extraordinary achievement and really helps to fill in the gaps in this movie. I hope he's finally been paid!",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is generally positive, albeit with some minor criticisms.

The reviewer also praises the special effects work, calling it an ""extraordinary achievement"" and expressing hope that the animator, William Sutton, has been fairly compensated.

The only criticisms mentioned are the jerky appearance of some footage due to the 30i to 24p conversion and the strange, non-sequitur appearance of Michael Jackson. However, the reviewer finds the latter encouraging, as it shows Jackson's continued support for his protégé. Overall, the review is lighthearted and playful, matching the tone of the film.

18915,"I don't understand why this movie has such a low rating. It totally deserves more! Sure, it's completely ridiculous, but that's what it was supposed to be. Don't expect cinematic transcendence from a movie about beauty pageant contestants stranded on a Caribbean island!

It has the strangest cast of characters all in the same movie. Michael Jackson, Evan Marriott, Joyce Giraurd, Stuart Pankin, Charlie Schlater and Eric Roberts. The special effects are hokey, but I think they're supposed to be since it's a silly comedy. There is apparently two versions of the film, one at Blockbuster and one on the official website: MissCastaway.com.

18918,"-That's pretty much the whole soundtrack to this film. I just saw this baby at the Munich Film Festival and it rocked the house. Director Doug Pray is never seen in this documentary, nor I think he is even heard, but he has done a very intimate look into the lives and history of the ""mixer."" He has segmented his film into about eight chapters and then his motley group of enthusiastic interviews will be spiced throughout according to what they are talking about. I was never big into ""scratching"" but the film does a wonderful job of keeping elementary for those who know little, and infusing in-jokes for those who are experts themselves in this area. Mix Master Mike from the Beastie Boys is in this film, but it wasn't until after the film that I could name several heavy hitters in the industry (DJ Shadow, Q- Bert, etc). The extreme fascination for turntables by these talented and quirky DJs is evident in their explanations of what their music means to them. The film also sheds some gratifying light on these guys (and one woman) to be classified as musicians. Pray doesn't let his film idle and if there exists a slow scene it is soon re-energized by hardly ever ceasing music. If nothing else, this film will increase your slang vocabulary. I have to get back to ""digging"", so I'll end this review. See it, it will be of interest. Good stuff man. Good stuff.",Positive,positive,positive,positive,"This review is extremely positive, conveying the reviewer's enthusiasm and admiration for the documentary film about DJs and turntablism.

18920,"The omission of Jazzy Jeff, the creator of the chirp and transformer scratch, raised a few eyebrows, but it's good to see he made it to the extras of the DVD after all. With SCRATCH, Doug Pray, who previously chronicled the grunge phenomenon of the '90s in HYPE (1996), made an excellent documentary about the world of the hip-hop DJ and the evolution of turntablism. His latest documentary, INFAMY (2005), explores contemporary American graffiti culture. After a couple of viewings four years ago, my DVD had been gathering dust ever since, but recently I watched it again and besides the subject material, I was surprised how well-shot and edited this documentary actually is. An immensely enjoyable soundtrack as well and not just talking heads, but lots of music, old school footage, parties, break dancing, you name it. One of the best things about the film, is that it mainly examines where the art of turntablism is today (in 2001 that is), without disregarding the pioneers of course.

Answer: Positive"
18921,"Being a huge fan of hip-hop and turntablism to begin with, I always knew I would like this film. However, I wasn't prepared for just how good the documentary actually is. It covers almost all the important aspects of the only element of hip-hop which has been there from the very start. The ""story"" begins in the early 70's, and follows the evolution of turntablism as an art from up until early 2000 (turntablism aficionados will point this out as significant).<br /><br />The editing is nigh on perfect throughout the film. Aside from the excellent visual ""scratch"" techniques which they used, the rapid cutting between interviews and the stock footage is excellent, giving the film pace when it is needed. The sound editing is also very good, with some nice sweeping sounds being used to help with transitions.<br /><br />The absence of a narrator was also welcome. We aren't taken by the hand through the story, and as a result the audience is able to make their own assumptions easier. Each DJ adds another side to the story, and it is so interesting to hear about the unknown stars of hip-hop, especially those who were there when hip-hop was being shunned left, right and centre by the music business.<br /><br />Although there are many excellent things about this film, I do have a few gripes. The biggest of these is the absence of several notable DJs, such as Ca$hMoney and Jazzy Jeff, and also DJs from outside America, such as Scratch Perverts and DJ Noise. However, if you watch the commentary on the DVD (something which I highly recommend), producer and director go in to great depth about how they regret not being able to feature them. The deleted scenes contain many interviews with Ca$hMoney, Jazzy Jeff and the Scratch Perverts.<br /><br />This is definitely the best documentary I've seen on hip-hop culture and music. It does stop short of showing the true potential of turntablism; for that I highly recommend checking out the DMC and ITF videos. However, that is a minor quibble. I highly recommend this movie, not least for the phat soundtrack, with excellent music throughout. (9/10)",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer expressing their admiration for the documentary's comprehensive coverage of turntablism's evolution, excellent editing, and engaging storytelling. The reviewer praises the film's ability to convey the history of turntablism without relying on a narrator, allowing the audience to form their own opinions and connections. The inclusion of interviews with lesser-known DJs adds depth to the narrative, providing a more nuanced understanding of hip-hop's early days.

The reviewer's few criticisms, such as the absence of notable DJs, are mitigated by the inclusion of deleted scenes and the producers' explanations on the DVD commentary.

18922,"Scratch is a documentary about DJs and their art of scratching. From that one line description of the film you would have no idea how entertaining and educational this little film is. It is a joyous and vibrant celebration of a cool subculture which is little known. It's filled with great underground hip hop music and you get to see some top DJs (e.g. DJ Q-Bert, DJ Shadow, and Mix Master Mike from the Beastie Boys) showing off their stuff. Going into the film I wasn't sure that ""scratching"" can really be called an art form, or that the turntable can be viewed as an instrument in its own right. Scratch completely changed my mind on these points. What these guys do with their turntables is truly amazing--it is definitely some kind of art--and the turntable, if you know how to use it, can be transformed into an instrument that you can ""play,"" as much as a drum or a guitar. And you even get a lesson on the basics of scratching from DJ Q-Bert (e.g. how to use the fader to get different sound effects). All these DJs in their own way were inspired to take up the art of scratching after watching Herbie Hancock perform his song ""Rock It"" (you remember that song, don't you?) live at the Grammys. What got their attention was not Hancock himself but his DJ and his scratching. Not only is Scratch about scratching, but it does some ""scratching"" of its own thanks to the creative way in which this documentary is shot and edited. There are moments where clips are quickly ""rewound"" and then ""forwarded"" several times, which mirrors (in the film medium) what happens when a DJ quickly moves the record on his turntable back and forth while using his fader (that ""wicka-wicka-wicka"" sound). Whether you're a fan of hip hop or not, you can count on Scratch to give you a very enjoyable night at the movies. After seeing it, I had an itch to go buy a turntable of my own. And I mean this as a compliment.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is extremely positive, praising the documentary ""Scratch"" for its entertaining and educational value.

18924,"This film is essentially for those who have had little or no introduction to hip-hop, specifically turntableism, as was the case with the director before he started this film. It was cool to have it focus on the bay more than expected, because NY is always getting all the credit, but comin from the bay the Q-Bert worship is a little out of control. This film didn't introduce anything new to me, but it did change my opinion in that going into it I was sketchy about the prospect of giving the tables the distinction of being a bona fide instrument. This film ought to convince anyone that it's right up there with the viola and clavichord.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is generally positive, as the reviewer appreciates the film's focus on the Bay Area's contribution to hip-hop and turntableism, which is often overshadowed by New York's influence. The reviewer, who is already familiar with the subject matter, didn't learn anything new from the film, but it did change their opinion on the legitimacy of turntables as a musical instrument. The reviewer praises the film for convincingly presenting turntables as a bona fide instrument, comparable to traditional instruments like the viola and clavichord.

The only criticism mentioned is the excessive admiration for Q-Bert, a renowned DJ from the Bay Area, which the reviewer finds a bit excessive. However, this is a minor complaint, and the reviewer's overall tone is one of appreciation and respect for the film's portrayal of turntableism.

18925,"Wow - most of the audience just seemed to shake their heads through much of this documentary at the sheer wizardry displayed on screen.<br /><br />The shift from the early days as a New-York based black-American phenomenon to current days as a racially diverse subculture (and largely West Coast-based) is profiled well.<br /><br />The humble turntable is not given the respect of any traditional musical instrument, but it can be so much more versatile and technically complex. These DJs take the required skills for any musical instrument - dexterity, rhythm and timing, among others - and apply them to a new technology with several more variables.<br /><br />DJ Qbert's comment that he pictures what ""music"" must sound like on advanced planets and then works it out, seemingly silly at first, makes more and more sense as you watch these guys go and spit out a multitude of sounds that no single traditional instrument could ever create!<br /><br />Some critics have said that this film focuses too much on certain 'stars' and squanders an opportunity to profile the wider hip-hop culture. One film at a time people!",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, expressing admiration for the documentary's portrayal of the DJing subculture.

The review also quotes DJ Qbert, highlighting the creative and innovative approach of these DJs, who can create a multitude of sounds that traditional instruments cannot. The reviewer dismisses criticisms that the film focuses too much on individual ""stars"" and neglects the broader hip-hop culture, suggesting that one film can only cover so much.

18927,"...scratch it. Just as African's created rhythms with the jawbone of an ass and Virgin Islanders welded oil drums into ear pleasing steel bands, so did urban DJ's itch to scratch in the pursuit of new methods of creative expression. ""Scratch"" is a wholly unnarrated documentary which will take you to the heart of the hip-hop/rap movement and explore the genesis of turntablism, the art of scratching vinyl, and the ultimate DJ/MC contempo entertainment expression.

18931,"Every review I have read so far seems to have missed a crucial point. Shakespeare wrote for the accent and the pronunciation just as he did for northerners in other plays. The Scottish accent changes the emphasis and rhythm of the language and affects profoundly what is said and the way it is taken. So, listen again and note the difference. The play is well done and the rhythm of the words are so much better than that provided by people using received, polite, well- enunciated English. I am reminded of the time a teacher in a school in Leicester, unknowingly, asked me, age 14, to read a piece of Walter Scott which was written in the tone of the Border. I come from the Border and when I read it as it should be read it made all the difference.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review stands out for its unique perspective, focusing on the significance of accent and pronunciation in Shakespeare's play. The reviewer argues that the Scottish accent fundamentally alters the emphasis, rhythm, and meaning of the language, which is often overlooked in traditional performances.

The reviewer's personal anecdote about reading Walter Scott's work in its intended Border tone highlights the transformative power of authentic pronunciation.

18932,"What do you mean son of actor, not an actor. You don't become an actor just because your daddy is a superstar---it doesn't work that way, not in UK at any rate.<br /><br />Macbeth (this version) is a low budget Scottish movie. You can't compare this to the Polanski version because Polanski has all the budgets in the world. <br /><br />Jason acted throughout school, but his big break came in 1985, when he landed the role of Robin Hood in Britain's ""Robin of Sherwood"" television series. He has appeared in many films since then, including ""Shanghai Noon"" and ""Lord of the Rings 2″. Jason has since moved behind the camera, forming the production company, Unconditional Entertainment. He recently wrapped filming on his latest movie, which stars Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ray Winstone. <br /><br />And all this has nothing to do with being the son of Sean Connery. If you think Jason said to Sean, ""daddy, I wanna be in Macbeth movie that they are going to film,"" and Sean said, ""sure, son, whatever you say,"" and made a phone call and got his son the role, you are mistaken. In fact, Jason Connery is being cut out of his father's will. Seeing as how his father is Sean Connery, that's a big chunk of change Jason will be losing out on. The reasoning behind the decision is apparently Sean's strong feelings that his only son should learn to provide for himself. The relationship has become fairly strained, with Jason even threatening to change his name. <br /><br />------------------------------------ Of being the son of Sean Connery,<br /><br />""I realize that I'm always going to be compared to my father.

The reviewer argues that Jason's success is not solely due to his father's influence, but rather a result of his own hard work and talent. The reviewer provides a brief overview of Jason's career, highlighting his early start in acting, his breakout role in ""Robin of Sherwood,"" and his subsequent film appearances. The reviewer also mentions Jason's transition to behind-the-camera work, forming his own production company and working with notable actors.

The reviewer takes issue with those who might assume Jason's success is solely due to his father's fame, emphasizing that Jason has earned his own way in the industry. The reviewer even shares a personal anecdote about Sean Connery's decision to cut Jason out of his will, citing his desire for Jason to learn to provide for himself. This adds a layer of authenticity to Jason's accomplishments, as he is not relying on his father's influence or wealth.

The reviewer concludes by urging readers to judge Jason's acting abilities based on his performances, rather than his family connections. The mention of Jason's role in ""Bullet to Beijing"" serves as a testament to his acting skills, encouraging readers to form their own opinions about his talent.

18933,"Thank goodness not all Dutch people are that ruthless. I think Jason is being judged like that by most people, simply because he has a famous father.

I knew Jason from other movies and of course Robin of Sherwood. But I must say I really liked his acting from this movie on. It was really good!<br /><br />During the movie, I actually forgot he was the son of. Sean.. who?<br /><br />And if you're a Shakespeare lover, I can recommend this movie. I'm sure you'll enjoy it!",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer expressing their admiration for Jason Connery's acting skills and the movie as a whole. The reviewer starts by defending Jason Connery, son of Sean Connery, from unfair criticism, suggesting that he is judged harshly due to his famous father.

The reviewer mentions that they enjoyed the movie and appreciated Jason's acting, even forgetting that he was the son of Sean Connery during the viewing.

The reviewer also recommends the movie to Shakespeare lovers, implying that the film is a worthy adaptation or interpretation of a Shakespearean work. The tone of the review is supportive and encouraging, with the reviewer expressing their enthusiasm for the movie and Jason's performance.

18934,"This is the fourth full-length feature film by Marc Recha. By the third 'les mans buides' -Empty hands- I promised myself not to cut my veins anymore. But this time round the plot is completely different -a kind of homage to Ramon Barnils (Sabadell 1940 - Reus 2001) a Catalan journalist-. The visuals in the trailer are stunning -a gleaming river bathed in sunlight- and the promise that Marc himself would be in front of the camera with his twin brother -none of both professional actors- convinced me at last, six weeks after its release. Abandon yourself in this very unusual road/river film. Learn almost nothing about Ramon Barnils but his most poignant legacy: his constant fight against amnesia of what we Catalans chose to forget. 'La batalla de l'Ebre' -look for Battle of the Ebro at the wikipedia- was lost not once but twice because after 40 years of silence and 25 years of half-hearted democracy nobody has done much to remember the legitimate side of the Spanish civil war and those who fought it.

The reviewer praises the film's ability to tackle a significant topic, the Spanish Civil War, and its aftermath, particularly the ""amnesia"" of the Catalan people regarding their past.

18935,"In August Days/Dies d'agost Marc Recha has given us a sun-saturated Catalan documentary-style road movie that's mostly a meandering improvised meditation on brotherhood and reclaiming the dead. The beautiful sometimes large-scale, richly atmospheric 35 mm. landscape images, nice soundtrack and Catalan-language narration are enchanting as a mood piece, if one is content with a trajectory that hasn't much momentum and doesn't lead anywhere in particular. Filmmaker Marc Recha and his non-identical twin David are the stars and the narrative is voiced by their younger sister. Marc had been researching the life of Ramon Barnils (1940-2001), a socialist editor who had been a family friend. He felt he was saturated with information and had to take a break. The break turned into making this film, which seeks to capture the mood of the interviews with Barnils' associates, thoughts about the Spanish Civil War, the drought season they were experiencing, the rugged landscape, the Recha brothers' affection for each other, swims and suntanned nudity and whatever characters or stories they ran into as they camped out of their van. This leads to pursuit of a giant catfish and the temporary disappearance of one of the brothers. In the end David has to go back to Barcelona to be with his daughter and Marc has to return to his project, and there it ends. I found it fascinating to listen to an extended narration in the Catalan language with its blend of Spanish and French-sounding words (perhaps linked with Provençal?). This isn't a major film but it commands attention and makes sense as a film festival choice with its clean visual and auditory beauty and its way of playing around with genres and blending autobiography with fiction and documentary in a fresh and thought-provoking way.<br /><br />An official selection of the 2006 New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review of ""August Days"" by Marc Recha is generally positive, highlighting the film's captivating atmosphere, beautiful cinematography, and enchanting soundtrack. The reviewer praises the film's ability to evoke a sense of mood and atmosphere, even if the narrative lacks momentum and a clear direction. The use of 35mm landscape images, the Catalan-language narration, and the soundtrack all contribute to the film's mesmerizing quality. The reviewer also appreciates the blending of genres, combining autobiography, fiction, and documentary elements in a fresh and thought-provoking way.

The reviewer's tone is more observational and descriptive, focusing on the film's aesthetic qualities and its ability to evoke a particular mood. While the reviewer notes that the film may not be a ""major film,"" it is still considered a worthy choice for a film festival due to its unique visual and auditory beauty.

This movie is one of the surprises. My friend recently bought this one, and in thinking it would be another cheesy kung-fu laugh riot, I was genuinely surprised at how good it was. I watch a lot of movies, and as a result, I can almost always call how a movie will turn out; and if there's a plot twist, what it will be. Not this movie!

18938,"I bought this a while back, during a massive martial arts movie phase. Although this certainly ain't the best, I do love this kind of film making, and there was a lot to keep me entertained in this one. Leung Kar Yan is one of my favorite martial arts stars, I always appreciate the fact that, whilst he lacked formal martial arts training, he usually gave a more than capable fighting performance. He also has a good beard. This movie has him in a good, heroic role and although he doesn't kick as much ass as in some of his other movies, he still acquits himself well. Early appearances from Cherie Chung and Chow Yun Fat are also nice too see, especially for the fact that Chow Yun Fat takes on the bad guys without his trademark gun play. He may not be a great fighter but he does OK. Eddy Ko is as great a bad guy as ever, he performs the same villainry as in many of his other films and does it great, as per usual. The fellow who plays Bu is good too, I don't recall his name, but he's in Magnificent Butcher too. Although the fighting isn't as good as other movies of the era, The postman fights back makes up for it with a lot of imagination, quality cinematography and a nicely quirky ambiance. There are some very nifty scenes, good characters and a good eclectic mixture of Hong Kong talents all coming together to decent effect. All in all, I would recommend this to kung fu and general Hong Kong action fans. It may not be a stylised classic like the Shaw Brothers films, or as crowd pleasing as Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee, but it is rock solid entertainment.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer expressing their enthusiasm for the film and its various aspects.

18939,"Sometimes it's hard to define what separates a successful, delightful comedy from one that falls flat. In this case, the contrived plot about a spoiled rich girl who schemes to take her nieces away from the Greenwich Village 'bohemian' who is raising them, only to fall for him herself, is not promising. And nothing in director Leigh Jason's filmography suggests that he was an overlooked major talent. And yet he must have been responsible for creating a relaxed, happy atmosphere on the set that was faithfully recorded on film.<br /><br />He also had the good sense to cast this movie properly. The one small flaw is Miriam Hopkins in a part that Ginger Rogers would have been perfect for. Hopkins is efficient but brittle, lacking the warmth and sexiness Rogers would have had. She is further hampered by a pair of bizarrely long and sooty false eyelashes that are sometimes a distraction. But a very young and very handsome Ray Milland couldn't be better in an exuberant, uninhibited comic performance of great charm.<br /><br />And better than that, particularly for New York City residents, is the Hollywood depiction of Greenwich Village in 1937. Though completely synthetic and idealized, it remains recognizable to a contemporary viewer. Art director Van Nest Polglase created an amiable jumble of mews apartments and ramshackle shared backyards that is the perfect backdrop for this picture's collection of artists, strivers, smart-alecks and wannabes. Best in the supporting cast is Guinn Williams, bringing sweetness and light to his role as a prizefighter-sculptor-dressmaker, suggesting the self-invention and fluidity (sexual and otherwise) of life in the Village. Even more refreshing are Betty Philson and Marianna Strelby playing the little girls. Plain, intelligent and full of humor, these girls seem like real human beings and are nothing like the professional child actors of the time.<br /><br />Of special interest are a couple of memorable comic set-pieces: Ray Milland's vacuum cleaner demonstration to a woman with a howling baby is played with more spontaneity than one expects (the baby and his contortions are marvelous 'found' moments) and a phony domestic 'play' in a department store window that degenerates into a free-for-all is also fun. The movie slides slowly downhill with a straight-faced custody trial and then never quite gets back on track when the action moves to Long Island, but this movie is still worth a look.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is generally positive, highlighting the film's charming atmosphere, strong performances, and nostalgic depiction of Greenwich Village in 1937. Despite acknowledging the contrived plot, the reviewer praises the director's ability to create a ""relaxed, happy atmosphere"" on set, which translates to the screen. The casting of Ray Milland is particularly commended, with the reviewer describing his performance as ""exuberant, uninhibited, and charming."" The supporting cast, including Guinn Williams and the child actresses, is also praised for their natural and humorous performances.

The review also appreciates the film's nostalgic value, particularly for New York City residents, with its idealized portrayal of Greenwich Village in the 1930s. The art direction, which created a ""jumble of mews apartments and ramshackle shared backyards,"" is also commended. The reviewer highlights a few memorable comedic scenes, including a vacuum cleaner demonstration and a department store window ""play"" that descends into chaos.

While the reviewer notes that the film's momentum slows down in the second half, particularly during the custody trial, they still recommend the movie as ""worth a look."" The only criticism is the casting of Miriam Hopkins, who is deemed ""efficient but brittle"" and lacking the warmth and sex appeal that Ginger Rogers would have brought to the role.

18940,"Society heiress Susan Fletcher (Hopkins) and her wealthy father Simon Fletcher (Henry Stephenson) are vexed that their young nieces Joan (Betty Philson) and Katie (Marianna Strelby) are living a Bohemian lifestyle in Greenwich Village with their artist uncle John (Milland) after the death of their parents (Susan's sister and John's brother). Simon has given up trying to convince John to allow he and Susan to take care of the children and have resorted to using private detectives to catch him in either unbecoming behavior or unemployed and therefore unable to care for the children properly. Susan finally decides to take matters into her own hands and goes to Greenwich Village herself, posing as an actress, to try to gain information and/or persuade him to see reason. What she discovers however, is that she not only likes the free and artistic lifestyle John and his friends are living and that the girls are being brought up well, but that she is quickly falling in love with John. Inevitably, her true identity is discovered and she is faced with the task of convincing everyone on both sides of the custody debate who should belong with whom.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film, and found that its very short running time (70 minutes) was the perfect length to spin this simple but endearing story. Miriam Hopkins, one of the great 1930's-1940's actresses is delightful in this film. Her energy, style and wholesome beauty really lend themselves to creating an endearing character, even though you know that she's pulling a fast one on the people she quickly befriends. This is the earliest film I've seen Ray Milland in, and he was actually young and non-patrician looking. (And apparently three years younger than his co-star) His energy and carefree manner in ""Wise Girl"" were a refreshing change to the demeanor he affects in his usual, darker, films. Honestly, though I am usually not remotely a fan of child actors, I really enjoyed the two young girls who played Susan's nieces. They were endearingly precocious, and were really the jewels of the film. Unfortunately, I can't dig up any other films that either of them were subsequently in after this one, which is a shame since both exhibited a large amount of natural talent.<br /><br />""Wise Girl"" was a film that was made three years after the Hollywood Code was instated, and to some extent, this was abundantly clear by the quick, happy ending, and the pie in the sky loftiness and ease with which the characters lived. The alleged Bohemian co-op was in fact a gorgeous cul-de-sac where the artists lived for free or for trade, and everything is tied up very nicely throughout. Fortunately, this was a light enough film and the characters were charming enough to make allowances for its fluffiness and short-comings and I was able to just take ""Wise Girl"" for what it was; a good old-fashioned love story that was as entertaining as it was endearing. Unfortunately, films of the romantic comedy/drama genre today are considerably less intelligent and entertaining, or I wouldn't find myself continuously returning to the classics. 7/10",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer expressing their enjoyment of the film ""Wise Girl"". The reviewer praises the performances of the lead actors, particularly Miriam Hopkins, who is described as ""delightful"" and possessing ""energy, style, and wholesome beauty"". The reviewer also appreciates Ray Milland's youthful and carefree performance, which is a departure from his typical darker roles. The child actors are also commended for their natural talent and endearing performances.

The reviewer acknowledges that the film's happy ending and idealized portrayal of the Bohemian lifestyle may be due to the Hollywood Code, but this does not detract from their overall enjoyment of the film. The reviewer notes that the film's lightheartedness and charm make up for its shortcomings, and that it is an ""old-fashioned love story"" that is both entertaining and endearing.

The only criticism mentioned is a comparison to modern romantic comedies, which the reviewer finds less intelligent and entertaining than classic films like ""Wise Girl"". However, this does not detract from the reviewer's overall positive assessment of the film, which is reflected in their 7/10 rating.

18941,"Of all the major 30s star actresses, Miriam Hopkins has been the most bizarrely overlooked and underrated. Her string of excellent 30s and 40s films is quite impressive but she is often referred to as stagy or brittle. Yet she had a great sense of humor and was memorable in several comedies, including this film, Old Acquaintance (with Bette Davis), and The Smiling Lieutenant (with Maurice Chevalier and Claudette Colbert). Hopkins was famous for her dislike of Hollywood, and the results has been a bad rep--undeserved.<br /><br />In Wise Girl she play an heiress trying to rescue the children of her dead sister from their guardian--the sister's brother-in-law (Ray Milland). The film offers several hilarious scene such as Hopkins taking a bath is a storeroom, Hopkins joining Milland and Guinn Williams in a Greenwich Village restaurant for $3 apiece to act as ""bohemians,"" and Hopkins going ringside during one of Williams' fights. Milland is also excellent and very funny.<br /><br />Hopkins and Milland make a great couple. The film also boasts solid support from Williams, Walter Abel, Henry Stephenson, James Finlayson, Margaret Dumont, Grace Hayle, Leonid Kinskey, and Inez Palange. The two girls are OK.<br /><br />But Hopkins, drunk on a ""slice of wine"" and wearing a pinned-together dress that is twice her size is hilarious as she blows at stray hairs while smoking.... A scream.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, celebrating the underrated talent of Miriam Hopkins and her impressive filmography. The reviewer argues that Hopkins has been unfairly overlooked and misunderstood, often being labeled as ""stagy"" or ""brittle,"" when in fact, she possessed a great sense of humor and excelled in comedies. The review highlights Hopkins' memorable performances in various films, including ""Wise Girl,"" where she plays an heiress trying to rescue her sister's children from their guardian.

The reviewer praises the film's humor, citing several hilarious scenes, including Hopkins taking a bath in a storeroom, pretending to be a bohemian, and attending a boxing match. The chemistry between Hopkins and Ray Milland is also commended, and the supporting cast is described as ""solid.""

18942,"""... the beat is too strong ... we're deaf mutants now--like them"", Rex Voorhas Ormine<br /><br />I am surprised that this movie has been uniformly bashed. Let me be the first to actually discuss the virtues of ""The Beat"" and why YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM NOW.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this movie is cheesy and ""bad"" in the conventional sense: the story is preposterous, the poetry is silly, and the acting is inconsistent.<br /><br />But these are the film's CHARMS--all of these ingredients form the recipe for one of the most UNDERAPPRECIATED CHEEZY FILMS of the 80's.<br /><br />If the reference to ""deaf mutants"" didn't pique your interest, then perhaps this will: What kind of name is ""Rex Voorhas Ormine"", anyway? It is such an unusual name (for North American audiences) that I said to myself, ""even the names of the characters in this friggin' movie are firggin' silly.""<br /><br />Well, ""The Beat"" is so fabulously cheezy that the ""meaning"" and ""symbolism"" behind ""Rex Voorhas Ormine"" is revealed not-too-subtly by Bart Waxman (the misguided guidance counselor you love to hate). I won't spoil the revelation behind Rex's name, but please don't get too excited, O.K.?<br /><br />Overall, the acting is inconsistent (John Savage--who plays the ""concerned teacher"" Mr. Ellsworth is pretty good, as is the fellow playing Bart Waxman, but the rest of the cast are unconvincing). That said, the acting does NOT detract from the film. Why? There is a SINCERITY in each of the actors' performances that makes the characters they play endearing. So although the performances may suck, you are still left with the impression that the actors are really trying to do their best. As a result, the actors' sincerity succeeds where their acting fails (which is quite often).<br /><br />The homage to ""beat poetry"" in this film is bad, bad, bad. But this is a good, good, good thing when it comes to entertainment. Would you actually enjoy ""better quality"" or ""more respectable"" poetry--especially in a film like this?<br /><br />Folks, that would be BORING (think about the droll they made us read in high school--sanitized to avoid ""corrupting the youth"", politically conservative and devoid of any critical analysis, etc.) Even if you don't like poetry or ""arty"" movies (with all of the ""intellectual"" posturing that implies), you most certainly can (and should) appreciate LUDICROUS POETRY in a WANNABE ART FILM!!!! How could you not enjoy the following?<br /><br />""do you remember the roar of the dinosaur? a woman's scotty craps on the floor bad scotty bad, oh the woman's so sad she washes her hands and then waits by the door today, yeah--today!""<br /><br />Yes, that is an example of some of the remarkable poetry liberally sprinkled throughout ""The Beat."" But what about the story, you ask?<br /><br />Well, the story is preposterous. But then again, that is the beauty of this film. Apart from some cliches, stereotypes, and predictable plot points, there are enough genuinely unique elements to the plot/story to keep things interesting. Who is Rex? Where did he come from? What the heck is he talking about? Deaf mutants? Illiterate angels? Do Billy and Kate REALLY understand what Rex is saying? Is the audience supposed to understand Rex and his poetry posse? (I've seen the movie several times and I still haven't figured everything out.)<br /><br />Will bad poetry and high school talent shows really END GANG VIOLENCE?<br /><br />I guarantee that you have never seen anything quite like ""The Beat""--a perfect combination of brilliantly bad poetry, mediocre-yet-sincere acting, and a ""mythopoetics conquers gang violence"" storyline that has YET TO BE RIVALLED BY ANY FILM EVER MADE.<br /><br />Bonus for fans of classic NYC hardcore: The Cro-Mags make a rare film appearance as the ""Iron Skulls"" and it's a hoot to see them perform several songs. I wish they included more concert footage, but maybe that will be an ""extra"" included on the ""collector's edition"" DVD I fantasize about.<br /><br />",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is a glowing endorsement of the film ""The Beat"", despite acknowledging its numerous flaws. The reviewer celebrates the film's cheesiness, bad poetry, and inconsistent acting, arguing that these elements combine to create a uniquely entertaining experience. The reviewer praises the film's sincerity, noting that the actors' genuine efforts to deliver their lines and performances make the characters endearing, despite their lack of skill. The review also highlights the film's camp value, citing the ridiculous poetry and over-the-top plot as reasons to appreciate the film.

The reviewer's enthusiasm is infectious, and their use of hyperbole (""YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM NOW"", ""BRILLIANTLY BAD POETRY"") conveys their excitement and admiration for the film. The review is not a traditional critique, but rather a celebration of the film's eccentricities and flaws. The reviewer's tone is playful and humorous, making the review an entertaining read.

18943,"My first review at IMDB, after a few years of using this site constantly...<br /><br />Anyways, saw this on the tube the other night, loved it. It's in the mindset of a Dangerous Minds or a Substitute, but much better. Was sure for a moment that Rex was Speedy Levitch, in Waking Life, but after checking, it doesn't seem so.<br /><br />I can see why many have problems with this plot and its poetry, but I also think these people are close-minded. Admittedly the ending wasn't quite what I was hoping for, but overall it was so unique and well-acted, I can't complain. I wouldn't call this cheesy, as one reviewer did, it pulled off the scene better than most films of the 80's did. And they refrained from playing any really dateable 80's music.<br /><br />Can't remember everything that made me smile when I saw this, but basically it realistically showed very creative individuals surrounded by mediocrity, and whether I share Rex's beliefs or not, I love original attempts to describe the meaning of life. And his Mutant theory is, to my knowledge, original. He rambled a lot as well, but they showed how confused he was at times, and why he might have some psychological issues. And then in his moments of clarity he was a philosopher extraordinaire, a person who noticed the little details in life and tried to give expression to them.<br /><br />Also I was very impressed with John Savage as the teacher. Usually actors fail at that role.

18944,"I think it's the sort of film you either love or hate and I'm really not the type to go in for arty movies. My mother rented ""mullhuland DR"" the other night and I nearly ran from the room, ha. But I love this film.<br /><br />We recorded ""The Beat"" one night when we had just let the tape run and got a great film that way by accident. Saved that tape and watched it a lot. I eventually got the VHS to add to my collection. I've watched it many times and at one point copied down the poems. I even tried to preform one scene for my high school drama class. She had said we could do any scene we wanted and just cut out the bad words. She refused to let me do it. If it could upset my drama teacher that much it has to be good :) Honest she never treated me the same after that.<br /><br />I liked the acting it came off very true and honest. It wasn't clean and polished but it was better than that. It was true to life, how anyone would truly behave and display emotions not how Hollywood does. It was great acting especially by the one playing Rex.<br /><br />The story was original. Not only do the characters get drawn into his world but you do too. Not your typical person meets inner city kids and saves them through knowledge film at all. Simply caring and friendship make things a bit better.<br /><br />The only thing is that even in the 80's there was more gun violence and less simple stuff like rock throwing but that little bit of innocence didn't hurt this film.<br /><br />I think it's a must see. you will either love or hate it but either way it makes an impact and that makes a good film that you will remember and talk about later.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, with the reviewer expressing their admiration for the film ""The Beat"".

18945,"The Beat was an exciting movie about a couple of young punks trying to survive in 1980's New York. This involves fighting with the other street gang that they directly share a high school class with, trying to stay in school, as well as going to local shows that involve bands that look like the Dead Kennedy's and have the name Skulls for their band name.

But in the end, the teachers at the school finally get to him and want to put him in a mental institution, he finally feels it is time to end his life, while Animals of Sound played without him. But they like to think that he is not dead, he is just living his life to the fullest, riding sharks and being happy living in the ocean. This movie, was one of those movies where I was glad that I watched it. While it was extremely entertaining, it also had a big message to it. Something a long the lines that these kids had no direction, no future, no figure heads to look up to, but because a troubled kid came along they all realized that there was way more important things to life then fighting the local black kids, or being destructive to everything. Rex showed them the beauty in angry music. Rex showed them the beauty in Rats, Disease and Murder. Rex showed they the beauty in almost everything, while some of those things have no beauty involved, they still were able to see that when used in poems, these poems speak to people.

18948,"You don't have to be a Notre Dame football fan to enjoy this, because I am not....but, as a football fan in general, this was fun to watch. It almost makes me a Fighting Irish devotee. If you can't get caught up in the emotion in this film, gridiron fan or not, you better check your pulse because this is an emotional film with some very touching scenes.<br /><br />As a sports fan, I loved watching the classic footage of early college games.

18950,"It's hard to imagine in this day and age how popular and how much of an impact a Norwegian immigrant and would be chemist had on the American public and how much of a national tragedy his sudden death in 1931 was viewed. But Knute Rockne was an extraordinary individual who both revolutionized and popularized college football and put a small obscure Catholic college on the map.<br /><br />I've heard clips of Rockne's famous pep talks and it is uncanny how Pat O'Brien got the voice and the inflection perfectly. In what turned out to be his career role, Pat O'Brien captures the integrity and fighting spirit that was Rockne. Rockne is assisted by well by Gale Page as Bonnie Stiles Rockne who complained about her home being a training camp for Notre Dame, but never threw anyone out of her house.<br /><br />Rockne's first impact on football was as a player with Notre Dame not a coach. One fine day in the second half of a losing football game against heavily favored Army, Rockne and team mate Gus Dorais played by Owen Davis used the forward pass as an offensive weapon. Before that football was simply a game where you just got bigger guys for your side and ran through the defense. Rockne didn't invent the forward pass, but he popularized and football became a game of strategy as well as brawn after that. <br /><br />Rockne knew how to work the media also. Those well publicized pep talks of his were not just to inspire his players. They were well publicized and it was in a lot due to him that college football became a major sport in that Golden Age of Sports in the Roaring Twenties. <br /><br />Playing a small, but key role is Ronald Reagan. As George Gipp, the first player Rockne coached to achieve greatness, Reagan not only got a good performance, but forever after a name that was handy in his subsequent political career. That deathbed scene which Rockne swore was accurate became a Republican battle cry as many a GOP underdog went out to win one for the Gipper.<br /><br />I still remember a widely distributed photograph in 1981 that was one of the first of recovering President Ronald Reagan at Notre Dame's graduation with his old friend Pat O'Brien. Reagan always credited O'Brien and Dick Powell of all the Warner Brothers stars of the period as the ones who were the kindest and most encouraging to a young player on the lot trying to make good.<br /><br />Notre Dame itself owes its prestige to Rockne. It's quite possible that Notre Dame would be an obscure small Catholic College without the reputation that football brought to it.<br /><br />Though George Gipp and the later famous backfield of the Four Horsemen certainly had their place in the sun it was Rockne who had the reputation. It's no accident that Warner Brothers was able to get Amos Alonzo Stagg, Glenn 'Pop' Warner, Howard Jones, and William Spaulding, Rockne's contemporaries and coaches with great reputations in their own right to appear in Knute Rockne, All American. It was there way of honoring the guy who was number one in their profession.<br /><br />I think more than football fans will enjoy Knute Rockne, All American.

18952,"The true life story of perhaps the greatest football coach the game has ever known. Knute Rockne led the game of football out of the ""stone age"" with innovations such as the forward pass and offensive formation shifts. But he is probably best known for his motivational locker room speeches. Along the way, he brought fame and glory to a tiny, little, unknown Catholic school in Indiana. Pat O'Brien is incomparable in his role as Rockne.

18954,"Some time ago, we read of the results of a poll taken by some Newspaper Sports Writers. The Questions posed were only two, and were brief and right to the point.<br /><br />The Question Number 1 asked respondent to tell who was his most Beloved college football team. Question Number 2 asked the fan to name his most Hated college football team. The answer to both questions was simply, Notre Dame! ND is tops on both lists! Yeah, love 'em or hate 'em, but you sure don't ignore ,em.<br /><br />The roots of this unique position of this Indepent* College Football Powerhouse are found in the life and career of one, grown-up, little Immigrant Norweigen boy from Chicago named Knute Rockne.<br /><br />As a biopic, the production of KNUTE ROCKNE, ALL-American(1940), came out relatively close to the death of Coach Rockne in a 1930 plane crash. It was about 10 years after that the film was released. That would mean that preliminary work on the project started about 8 years after our Nation's great loss of Mr. Rockne.<br /><br />His likeness and voice were well known from Newspapers, Radio and Motion Picture News Reels. Both Knute's Widow,Bonnie Skiles Rockne, and the University of Notre Dame had approval rights in choosing the Actor to play the Lead and okaying the script. We think that they could not have done the job any better. Pat O'Brien truly looks the part and was himself a footballer in college. Ronald Reagan is cast in the pivotal role of George Gipp**, a free spirited student going to Notre Dame on a Baseball scholarship! He was a ""walk-on"" football player.<br /><br />The cast runs full of talented players. We have Griffith Veteran,Donald Crisp as Fr. Callaghan, C.S.C., Notre Dame President. Albert Basserman is Fr. Newland, the Chemistry Prof and Rockne mentor. Gail Page appears as the Mrs., Bonnie Skiles Rockne. Owen Davis,Jr. is Rockne cohort, Gus Dorais(the passer in that historic ND vs. ARMY Game at West Point.)<br /><br />The cast is rounded out by Kane Richmond, Nick Lukats, William Marshall and William Byrne as the Four Horsemen. Real life Big Time College Coaches Howard Jones, 'Pop' Warner, Bill Spaulding and Amos Alonzo Stagg appear as themselves in scenes of Congressional Probe into College Sports and add an authentic touch. <br /><br />As for biopic,KNUTE ROCKNE ALL-American!,all one can only say that it hits the ground running, and did not slow down from beginning to end. There is no wasted time either. All the screen time is used to move the story along. <br /><br />Use of Notre Dame Choir, the Campus itself and all that Brass Band rah-rah march music all ad to the feeling of really being there.***<br /><br />* To this day,even though their Basketball Team and other sports teams compete in the Big East Conference, Notre Dame remains an Independent in NCAA Football. What this means, that in effect, The Fighting Irish play a national schedule.<br /><br />** There was no such agreement with the Family of George Gipp. There was a lawsuit some years ago over the scene portraying young Mr. Gipp giving the famous ""Win Onr For The Gipper Speech"". Television prints of this KNUTE ROCKNE ALL-AMEICAN were minus the speech in the death bed scene.<br /><br />*** Other Notre Dame themed Films were made over the years. THE SPIRIT OF NOTRE DAME (Universal 1931)featured J. Farrell McDonald as a Rockne look-alike coach. It also featured Lew Ayers, Andy Devine Nat Pendleton, as well as the members of the real Notre Dame Championship Teams featuring the real Four Horsemen. Then of course, we have RUDY (Tri-Star 1993)with Sean Astin, Jon Favreau, Ned Beatty and Charles Dutton, among others, in a fine cast. There was also talk of an unauthorized film, critical of Notre Dame called GOLDEN GLORY, but nothing has materialized, has it?(Let me know, Dear Reader, THANX!!)<br /><br />**** Warner Brothers always had great music in their, both in opening themes and in incidental music. In this Rockne Movie, they have incorporated THE NOTRE DAME FIGHT SONG in the score. Along with it were STEP NOTRE DAME and THE NOTRE DAME ALMA MATER, which had its premiere at the Rockne Funeral in 1930 at the Notre Dame Basilica.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, detailing the biopic ""Knute Rockne, All-American"" as a well-crafted and engaging film that effectively tells the story of the legendary Notre Dame football coach.

18955,"Knute Rockne led an extraordinary life and his story is told rather well in Knute Rockne All American. We follow Rockne's incredible journey from young Norwegian boy to iconic American football legend. Produced in 1940 the film may at times seem a touch dated and at times downright hokey. And the filmmakers do lay it on a bit thick at times as Rockne is glowingly and lovingly portrayed. You may come away thinking Rockne should have been nominated for sainthood when in fact he was, after all, just a football coach. But it is undeniable that he had a great impact on the game of football as well as having a tremendous impact on the lives of so many of the young men he coached. This film shows the great impact he had and gives you an insight into why he is so revered to this day.<br /><br />Playing Rockne, Pat O'Brien gives an impressive performance. It's unquestionably O'Brien's movie to carry and he makes the film and the character his own. The real-life Rockne was renowned as a great inspirational figure and O'Brien's performance will make you understand why. The only quibble comes early in the film when O'Brien, in his early forties, is playing the college student Rockne in his early twenties. All the makeup in the world wasn't going to make that believable and the effect is rather jarring. But as the Rockne character ages and begins his legendary coaching career O'Brien fits the part perfectly.<br /><br />As for the rest of the cast one name jumps out and that is of course Ronald Reagan playing the young, charismatic, but ultimately doomed football star George Gipp. In the grand scheme of the film it's not really a large part, with Reagan appearing for no more than 10-15 minutes. But the performance has become legendary thanks to Reagan's famous ""Win one for the Gipper"" deathbed speech. It's a brilliantly-played scene, chock-full of emotion. Reagan may not have been on the screen for very long in this film but he certainly made a tremendously positive impact in a winning performance.<br /><br />The rest of the film strikes a balance between football and life in general with Rockne having great lessons for his young men in both areas. For football fans (and history buffs) there is a rare treat as actual archival footage from Notre Dame games of the Rockne era is interspersed throughout the film. It's a rare opportunity to see just how much the game has evolved in the last six-plus decades and an opportunity to see Rockne's legendary strategic innovations put into practice. If you're a Notre Dame fan you'll probably enjoy the fact that the Notre Dame Victory March provides a seemingly constant soundtrack for the film. If you're a Notre Dame hater...well, then you're probably not watching this movie anyway. Knute Rockne All American is an inspiring, uplifting, emotional film. Perhaps a tad overly sentimental but that's not such a bad thing. It's a very enjoyable film, one well worth taking the time to see.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review of ""Knute Rockne All American"" is overwhelmingly positive, despite acknowledging some minor flaws. The reviewer praises the film's portrayal of Knute Rockne's life, calling it ""rather well told"" and appreciating the insight it provides into Rockne's impact on the game of football and the lives of those he coached. The performance of Pat O'Brien as Rockne is particularly highlighted, with the reviewer noting that O'Brien makes the film and character his own. The review also praises Ronald Reagan's memorable appearance as George Gipp, citing his iconic ""Win one for the Gipper"" speech.

While the reviewer notes that the film may seem dated and occasionally hokey, they argue that these flaws are outweighed by the film's inspiring and uplifting qualities. The inclusion of archival footage from Notre Dame games of the Rockne era is seen as a rare treat, and the reviewer appreciates the balance struck between football and life lessons. The only significant criticism is the brief, jarring moment when Pat O'Brien, in his early forties, plays the college student Rockne in his early twenties.

Overall, the review concludes that ""Knute Rockne All American"" is an enjoyable, inspiring, and emotional film, well worth watching.

They very quickly become good friends and Tommy does his best to help his friend. The only problem is that their superior at work, a tough worker Charles Malik (Jack Warden) is sort of envious of their friendship as well as Tommy's constant happy disposition and success in personal life.

18957,"Martin Ritt's first film offers an exceptional existentialist answer (three years later) to Elia Kazan's more conservative ""On The Waterfront."" While ""Waterfront"" benefited immensely from an electrifying Marlon Brando, who inadvertently disguised Kazan's offensive theme of trying to justify naming names (as Kazan did eagerly before the House Un-American Activities Committee), ""Edge of the City"" boasts a young John Cassavetes and an upstart Sidney Poitier daring to confront issues that ""Waterfront"" failed to acknowledge, namely, workers' rights and race relations.<br /><br />""Edge of the City"" boldly dives into this (then) unknown territory, and although the quite appealing black protagonist (Poitier) may seem a bit Hollywood simplistic, the courageous struggle against thinly-veiled bigotry and violence has hardly aged at all. One wonders how shocked initial 1957 moviegoers were at such a bold presentation of white-black relations (if some of the bigoted didn't leave the theater early, they must of left dumbfounded, if not offended). <br /><br />The last reel of the film will still surprise audiences, as it refuses to sink into expected clichés, including those that tainted ""Waterfront."" Only the most jaded viewers will not realize what a radical and entertaining film ""Edge of the City"" ends up being.<br /><br />What's most disturbing about this lost classic: how it sadly remains unavailable on any format, for reasons that remain quite cloudy.

The reviewer highlights the strong performances of John Cassavetes and Sidney Poitier, and notes that the film's exploration of racial tensions and bigotry remains relevant and impactful even today.

The reviewer's enthusiasm for the film is evident in their language, using words like ""exceptional,"" ""bold,"" ""courageous,"" and ""radical"" to describe it.

I've been in fights like these myself, although no one got killed.<br /><br />The introduction of Sidney Poitier's widow is a variation on Shakespeare's Shylock ""Do I not bleed?""

18960,"""Edge of the City"" is another movie that owes a lot of credit to ""On the Waterfront"". From it's NYC locations, to its score, to the belief that whatever trouble you may be in, you can somehow right your wrongs.<br /><br />""Edge"" also deals with ideas like loyalty and racism. In my opinion, that is where the movie does not succeed like ""Waterfront"". At 85 minutes the movie rushes through the establishment of relationships, and ties everything up so quickly that much of it seems forced and unbelievable.<br /><br />Possible Spoilers****<br /><br />The relationship between Sidney Poitier and John Cassavettes could have been further developed in the beginning. I don't believe that these two characters, from two very different places would have built such a strong relationship so quickly. <br /><br />I think that the whole love sub-plot with Cassavettes could have been eliminated. He is so awkward with a woman that it becomes painful to watch. The only reason why it is in the movie is so that she can motivate him to do the right thing at the end. There are other ways that they could have shown this. I would have also liked to see some scenes of Axel in the army to illustrate why he is the way he is.<br /><br />The acting is excellent. Poitier is terrific in a role that is beautifully written. His role as Tyler is interesting and multi-layered, and (especially for 1957), a man who is confident, respected, and intelligent. Cassavettes, as Axel North, while very good, does not seem quite right for the part. Warden is terrific as the boss who knows Axel's secret (although his fight scene with Cassavettes at the end is staged horribly. Too many break-away boxes). I thought Ruby Dee was wonderful in role of Poitier's wife.<br /><br />On the whole, ""Edge of the City"" is a smart, movie with a very good cast that tries too hard to be an interesting noir style picture, without taking the time to let the drama build.<br /><br />7 out of 10",Positive,"Mixed, but overall: Negative",Mixed,positive,"This review provides a mixed assessment of the film ""Edge of the City"".

18962,"Although this small film kind of got lost in the wake of On The Waterfront, Edge Of The City can certainly hold its own with that star studded classic. It's another story about the docks and the code of silence that rules it.<br /><br />Next to the corrupt union that Lee J. Cobb ran in On The Waterfront, Jack Warden is really small time corruption. But he's real enough as the gang boss on one of the docks who intimidates the other workers by being handy with his fists and the bailing hook and he gets the rest to kickback part of their hard earned money. And it's all hard earned money in that job.<br /><br />One guy Warden can't intimidate is Sidney Poitier another gang boss and when he tries to intimidate newcomer John Cassavetes, Poitier takes him under his wing. The two develop quite the friendship and Poitier and his wife Ruby Dee even fix Cassavetes up with Kathleen Maguire.<br /><br />Warden is truly one loathsome creature and it's sad how by sheer force of personality and physical prowess he cows almost everyone else into submission. In that sense he's tougher than Lee J. Cobb who did have to rely on an impression collection of goons to enforce his will in On The Waterfront.<br /><br />Edge Of The City marked the big screen directorial debut of Martin Ritt who did a great job with a good cast of New York based players and spot on location cinematography. The film's low budget does show, but you're so impressed with the ensemble cast you don't really care.<br /><br />Cassavetes as the loner with a past and the hip and tough Poitier are both fine, but my personal favorite in this film is Ruby Dee.

18965,"1957's Edge of the City, directed by Martin Ritt, stars John Cassavetes, Sidney Poitier, Jack Warden and Ruby Dee. It's the story of a troubled man, Axel, who has a mysterious past that gradually comes out during the film. He has a connection that gets him a job on a loading dock working for Charlie (Jack Warden), a real meanie who takes kickbacks from his workers and rides them hard. Charlie has an intense dislike for a black man, T.T. (Poitier) who holds the same position. T.T. invites Axel to work on his team; Axel defies Charlie and does so. Axel finds a place to live and socializes with T.T., his his wife (Dee) and their son's white schoolteacher (Kathleen McGuire). When tragedy strikes, none of the men on the loading dock will talk to the police, and Axel has to come to grips with his values, what he stands for, and the meaning of friendship.<br /><br />This is a really excellent black and white film that curiously isn't really about being black or white! It's really about the limits one puts on oneself and knowing who you are. Charlie is a bigot and hates that a black man has a good position on the dock. T.T. teases Charlie and gives as good as he gets. There's no discussion of T.T. and Axel spending time together or of T.T.'s son having a white teacher with whom the family also socializes. What Axel, a loner, finds difficult is accepting any friendship or confiding in anyone - these things he learns through T.T.<br /><br />Poitier absolutely shines in ""Edge of the City"" - he's warm, energetic, loving and smart, a man with a real enthusiasm for life, afraid of nothing. Cassavetes is excellent and plays a character totally opposite - hiding in the shadows, chronically depressed and always nervous.<br /><br />The film leaves open what happens to Axel. Whatever does, he's a different man now.<br /><br />Strangely underrated and unknown film, possibly in the shadow of a lot of the angry young men films that came out in that era.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the 1957 film ""Edge of the City"" for its thought-provoking themes, strong performances, and nuanced exploration of human relationships. The reviewer highlights the film's ability to transcend racial tensions, instead focusing on the universal struggles of self-discovery, friendship, and personal growth. The reviewer commends the performances of Sidney Poitier and John Cassavetes, noting their contrasting characters and the chemistry between them. The film's black-and-white cinematography is also praised, adding to the overall atmosphere of the film.

The reviewer's enthusiasm for the film is evident in their description of Poitier's performance as ""warm, energetic, loving, and smart,"" and Cassavetes' portrayal of a ""chronically depressed and always nervous"" character. The reviewer also appreciates the film's open-ended conclusion, which leaves the audience pondering the protagonist's future. The only negative comment is a lament that the film is ""strangely underrated and unknown,"" overshadowed by other films of the era.

18966,"This is a powerful film which seems to have never re-arisen after the Joe McCarthy censorship period. It influenced me as a Jewish teen-ager who had friends of various colors and whose father's family had suffered under the Fascist regimes in Europe during the second quarter of the Twentieth Century. Unlike the later rip-off, ""On The Waterfront"" which seemed to take some of the same themes and twist them to fit the enforced Hollywood political correctness of the time, it told its story direct and with respect for the characters and for the reality it fictionally reflected. It was an antidote to ""Gone With the Wind"", ""Birth of a Nation"", ""Triumph of the Will"" and so many other glorifiers of hatred and violence. I would place it alongside the recent German film (also virtually hidden in the US), ""Rosenstrasse.""<br /><br />I remember that the TV version, also black and white in format as well as story, was blacked out by some stations because the black hero's wife appeared white. As a young civil rights worker, it produced a conflict for me because on the one hand I was opposed to smoking cigarettes and on the other opposed the boycott in Georgia of a sponsor of the TV show, a major tobacco company (I no longer remember which one -- does anyone else?).<br /><br />I would love to find a CD of either the film or the TV show to let my sons see something that informed my opposition to racism universally (as opposed to only fighting racism against Jews) and recognition of the inherent connection between racism and militarism.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is a heartfelt and deeply personal tribute to a film that had a profound impact on the reviewer's life.

18967,"The reason why this movie isn't any better known and more appreciated to me seems because of its subject. Because of its controversial subject this movie never got a proper big release and still remains a fairly unknown one to this very day. Not that it's subject is that controversial now anymore though.<br /><br />Basically in essence it's a movie about a white man befriending a black man. The friendship does not seem forced or unrealistic but the way it gets portrayed in this movie makes it all feel very real. We see these different ethnics mingle in with each other, as if it's just completely normal. Unfortunately of course back in those days it really wasn't regarded as anything normal. Seeing a black man talking to a white girl and just having fun with her as a friend must have been an hard thing to watch for instance for some proportions of its 1957 audience.<br /><br />You can really understand why Sidney Poitier has always been and still is being respected so much by the Hollywood society and the black-community in general. Of course it's one of the reasons why he also received an Honorary Award at the Oscar's, in 2002. In his movies he often fights against discrimination and prejudiced issues, with of course ""In the Heat of the Night"" as the best example of this. A real role model, that certainly has inspired many Afro-American actors, to this very day. But on top of that, he also was a great actor. Yes, he is still alive but he has pretty much retired completely from movies now it seems, since his last credited role is from 2001.<br /><br />This movie was Martin Ritt's directorial debut and he also wasn't given too much movie to spend on his movie. The studios were probably also a bit reluctant mainly because of its concept and/or because it was Ritt's first movie. Or perhaps it was simply due to the fact that MGM just wasn't that big anymore and it had left its best days behind them. Ever since the '50's on Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer sort of had the reputation of making not too great and cheap movies, while in the early years before that it was really one of the biggest studios with lots of stars and acclaimed directors attached to it, who made many award winning classic movies. Luckily for them their reputation is starting to change again and whenever the MGM-logo appears at a movie people are no longer expecting a lesser-movie anymore.<br /><br />Anyway, even with its restrained budget and limited resources they managed to make a great movie out of this one. The movie is very simple, with only a few characters and a simplistic plot in it. The movie however still manages to capture you with its story and subjects, without ever starting to become preachy or anything about it. It makes the movie an effective one as well with its subjects.<br /><br />Really a movie that deserves to be seen.<br /><br />8/10",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, praising the film for its groundbreaking portrayal of interracial friendship and its thought-provoking exploration of racial tensions in the 1950s. The reviewer acknowledges that the film's subject matter may have contributed to its relative obscurity, but argues that it is a powerful and important work that deserves to be seen. The review highlights the strong performances, particularly from Sidney Poitier, who is hailed as a role model and a great actor. The reviewer also commends the director, Martin Ritt, for making the most of a limited budget and resources to create a simple yet effective film that tackles complex issues without becoming preachy.

18968,"Highlighting the acting of Sidney Poitier and the brooding on-screen presence of John Cassevetes, The Edge of the City is a highly-watchable film from the fifties, directed by Martin Ritt. There is great acting and stunning on-location photography in black and white.<br /><br />Poitier is a delight at this point in his career and Tommy Tyler, the character he plays is happy and outgoing. He befriends Axel Noordman, played by Cassevetes, who is a young man suffering from poor self-esteem and a past that he wants kept under wraps. Tyler, a black man, brings his friend out of his shell and introduces him to his family and a new girlfriend.<br /><br />Tyler and Noordman are employed on the New York docks at a time when the workers were expected to tow the line, if they knew what was good for them. The boss Charles Malik, played by Jack Warden, in one of his many hard-bitten roles becomes the focus of discontent, which leads to a climactic showdown with Noordman.<br /><br />At the end of the movie, we are left with mixed emotions. However, the two main characters have left the audience with a story of friendship between two different men in a hostile world.",Positive,Positive,positive,positive,"This review is overwhelmingly positive, highlighting the strengths of the film ""The Edge of the City"" directed by Martin Ritt.

18969,"Axel Nordman (Cassavetes) shows up on the New York dockyards looking for a job, but with a hidden past. He gets one on condition that he pay a kick back to surly crew boss Jack Warden. While there, he strikes up a friendship with black man Sydney Poitier that unfortunately leads to a gut-wrenching moral dilemma for a man who, we learn, typically runs from his problems.<br /><br />The movie looks like Oscar winner On the Waterfront, feels like On the Waterfront, and most importantly, plays much like that 1954 Kazan production. However, its racial theme is ground-breaking for the time. The black Poitier and the white Cassavetes are treated as equals in every respect. It might even be called the first of the black-white ""buddy"" pictures that would later dominate so many action films.<br /><br />It helps that the two leads play so well off each other. Nonetheless, the movie's central flaw is failing to indicate why crew-boss Poitier pushes a friendship with the dour Cassavetes in the first place. He really goes out of his way to befriend the newcomer. But why he would cross racial barriers to do so is never really suggested. One possible explanation is that Poitier wants to use Cassavetes as a pawn in his rivalry with other crew-boss Warden, but then comes to genuinely like the guy. There's a hint of that in some of Cassavetes's suspicious reactions, but beyond that, the relationship appears unmotivated.<br /><br />If there's a single stage shot in the entire movie, I couldn't spot it. Everything is done on seedy New York location, without the usual movie extras. In that sense, it's an anti-Hollywood production, carefully deglamorized even down to the night club scene which itself looks like a real after-hours crowd. I suppose sociologists would dub this rather raw slice-of-life ""a glimpse of the working poor"".<br /><br />Yet, for all its virtues, which are many, the film remains too close to the Brando-Kazan movie for comfort. Here, a fine unknown actress Kathleen Maguire gets the role of the redemptive girl friend, Warden the role of the corrupt labor boss, while Cassavetes, like Brando, must suffer a bloody beating before regaining his moral standing and doing the right thing. Still and all, despite the derivative nature, the gritty urban drama retains enough of the original force to merit a look-see.",Positive,Positive,Positive,positive,"This review provides a mixed assessment of the film, acknowledging both its strengths and weaknesses. On the positive side, the reviewer praises the film's groundbreaking racial theme, treating black and white characters as equals, and the strong performances of the leads, Cassavetes and Poitier. The film's gritty, realistic portrayal of working-class life in New York, achieved through on-location shooting and a deglamorized aesthetic, is also commended. The reviewer notes that the film's raw, slice-of-life quality provides a unique glimpse into the lives of the working poor.

However, the reviewer also identifies some flaws, particularly the unmotivated friendship between the two leads. The reviewer questions why Poitier's character would go out of his way to befriend Cassavetes' character, suggesting that the relationship lacks a clear motivation. Additionally, the reviewer notes that the film's narrative is overly reminiscent of ""On the Waterfront,"" with similar plot elements and character archetypes, which detracts from the film's originality.

Despite these criticisms, the reviewer concludes that the film is still worth watching, citing its gritty urban drama and strong performances. While the film's derivative nature is acknowledged, the reviewer suggests that it retains enough of its original force to merit attention.

18970,"I first saw this film on cable in the 80's and it rocked me to the core. It showed up again on TV about six months ago.<br /><br />Filmed on location, the black and white cinematography graphically portrays 1950's New York as the gritty ""urban jungle"" at a time when there was far more industry and port activity in the city, particularly in Manhattan.<br /><br />John Cassavetes always brought a special intensity to his acting, and is magnificent in the role of the army dodger. His brief 1959 TV series ""Johnny Staccato"" is also a joy to watch.<br /><br />Sidney Poitier and (later in the film) Ruby Dee bring freshness and vitality to their roles. But it is Jack Warden's superb acting as the vicious, brutal shift boss that grabbed my attention. To get an idea of Warden's versatility, watch this film, then check out a 1962 episode of the TV series ""Naked City"" entitled ""Specter of the Rose Street Gang (available on video).""

18972,"Clearly patterned after the first gangster movies that Warner produced the same year,Little Caesar (1931) and The Public Enemy (1931),this gangster movie is one of the better efforts I've seen. Although not quite in the same league as the previous mentioned classics, it has a powerful performance by young Sylvia Sidney.She's magnificent and delivers her lines more natural than perhaps anyone did at the time.Gary Cooper is better than usual at this stage in his career and shows signs of what would follow the next few years when he rose to the top. The movie has some fascinating villains in Paul Lukas (never seen him this detestable) and Guy Kibbee (what a shock to see him act the hoodlum).The direction of Rouben Mamoulian is very inventive,probably the first voice-over to show a persons thoughts appear in this movie.

Wonderful scene-fades, creative camera angles, symbolic allusions--Mamoulian just keeps exploring the directorial medium and coming up with innovation.<br /><br />This was Sylvia Sidney's first role in Hollywood, after her success on the New York stage, and she is just as lovely as a Gary Cooper leading lady ought to be. It's nice to see her in a role with a harder edge than many she was given--so often she looks like she's afraid she's about to be hit by someone.<br /><br />There are lots of familiar faces in this film, including the wonderful Wynne Gibson.

As for the reviewer who believes Gary Cooper was too stupid to have dialogue more complex than ""Yep"" or ""Nope,"" he should perhaps consider Coop's performance in films such as ""Mr Deeds Goes to Town"" or ""Meet John Doe.""

18974,"I thought I'd witnessed every wrinkle the crime/gangster flick had to offer, but the Garrett-Marcin-Hammett combination pull off some genuine thrills and surprises here, thanks to the inventively forceful direction by Mamoulian, the atmospheric photography by Lee Garmes, plus remarkably sharp film editing and flawless special effects. Brilliant acting helps too. Coop gives one of his most convincing performances as the reticent hayseed-turned-fearless bootlegger (the sort of character progression he was to repeat in other roles such as Sergeant York). Miss Sidney (pictured center) in her first major role is also an eye-opener.

I keep guessing how the director and his staff, including editing, sound, lighting, photography, could have been so brilliant.

18980,"I was wandering through my local library, browsing VHS tapes, when I saw a movie that made my mouth drop--Waterbabies. I have been hoping to see this movie again--it's been over 22 years since I saw it (cable-movie channel around 78-79). I had recalled a good many of the details--Grimes in particular. My son, who is 4, and I watched it.<br /><br />He agreed with me that Grimes was ""Not nice"", and the best way for me to describe it was that he didn't love Tom. He accepted that. It was amazing that I still recalled some of the songs, too! They had stuck in my head for 22 years--which means they had to have some memorable-ness, eh?<br /><br />It's a good child's movie, with parental guidance in case of questions about what children had to go through that were not nobility/society in the time-frame. This is what all the children faced daily (except for a few lucky ones), and while we try to Disney-coat movies, making them more pc for children these days, it doesn't mean that cruelty didn't exist--or even still doesn't. I enjoyed the animation. It wasn't Disney, no. I don't think Don Bluth touched a paintbrush on this movie.<br /><br />There's a lot going for it, though. David T plays two roles! (I really like him!) James M does too. The waterbabies themselves are cute. You feel sorry for Tom, and root for him.
